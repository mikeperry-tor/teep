**Verify that AI providers can't read your prompts — even if they wanted to.**

When you type a prompt into an AI API, the company can read everything — your questions, your code, your medical questions, your unreleased ideas. Teep changes that. It's a local proxy that sits between your app and the AI provider, verifies the model is running in a secure hardware vault, and encrypts your conversation so only that hardware can read it — not the company, not their employees, not an attacker who's compromised their servers.

```
Client (any OpenAI SDK) ──► localhost:8337 (teep)
                                │
                                ├── Prove the server is genuine hardware
                                ├── Encrypt so only that hardware can read it
                                └── Return plaintext to your app
```

## Works With

Teep works with any OpenAI-compatible app. Change the base URL to `http://127.0.0.1:8337/v1` in your app's settings:

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) · [IronClaw](https://www.ironclaw.com/)

[Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com) · [AnythingLLM](https://anythinglm.com) · [LibreChat](https://librechat.ai)

[Aider](https://aider.chat) · [Cline](https://cline.bot) · [Opencode](https://opencode.ai)

## Quick Start

Binary releases coming soon. For now, requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/13rac1/teep/cmd/teep@latest

# Set API keys for whichever providers you want to use
export VENICE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export NEARAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export CHUTES_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Start the proxy — all providers with a configured key are active simultaneously
teep serve
```

Query `/v1/models` to see all available `provider:model` combinations:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8337/v1/models | jq '.data[].id'
# "venice:e2ee-qwen3-5-122b-a10b"
# "neardirect:Qwen/Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct"
# "chutes:deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324-TEE"
# ...
```

Point any OpenAI-compatible client at `http://127.0.0.1:8337` and use the `provider:model` format:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8337/v1", api_key="unused")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="venice:e2ee-qwen3-5-122b-a10b",
    # model="neardirect:Qwen/Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct",
    # model="chutes:deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324-TEE",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from a TEE"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

## How It Works

Before forwarding your request, teep asks three questions:

1. **Is the hardware real?** — The server proves it's running on genuine Intel and NVIDIA hardware. A fake server can't forge this proof.

2. **Is the encryption real?** — The encryption key was generated inside the verified hardware. The provider cannot intercept it.

3. **Is the software trustworthy?** — Container images and deployment configuration are verified against public transparency logs that can't be altered.

If any enforced check fails, teep blocks the request. Run `teep verify` to see the full report.

## Attestation Verification

Run a standalone check against any configured provider:

```bash
teep verify venice --model e2ee-qwen3-5-122b-a10b
```

Teep checks up to 29 factors across hardware, encryption, and supply chain, then prints which pass, fail, or skip. Factors that skip are typically optional policy checks not configured for your setup. Factors that fail are known current limitations — see [attestation gaps](docs/attestation_gaps/) for details.

Exits with code 1 if any enforced factor fails. For the full factor list, see [Verification Factors](#verification-factors).

## FAQ

**Does this slow down my app?**
The first request to a provider takes an extra 200–500ms while teep fetches and verifies the attestation. After that, results are cached for 10 minutes — subsequent requests add under 1ms.

**What does this actually protect against?**
Teep protects your prompts from the AI company's employees, a compromised data center, and a network attacker who can see your traffic. It does not protect against a malicious model or hardware backdoors. See [Verification Factors](#verification-factors) for exactly what each provider currently proves.

**What if verification fails?**
Teep blocks the request and returns an error. It never forwards a request to an unverified provider. Run `teep verify` to see exactly which checks failed and why.

**Do I need to trust teep?**
Teep runs entirely on your machine. Your prompts never pass through a teep server. You can verify the binary's own build provenance with `teep self-check`.

**Is this free?**
Yes. Teep is open source under AGPL-3.0. Dual licensing is available for commercial use.
