# TDX Measurement Allowlists

Teep can enforce allowlists for TDX measurement registers to verify that a CVM
booted the expected software stack. This document covers how allowlists work,
how to configure them, and where to find canonical values for cross-checking.

## Background

Intel TDX measures the CVM boot chain into several registers:

| Register | Measures | Varies With |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| MRSEAM   | Intel TDX module identity | TDX module version, platform generation |
| MRTD     | Virtual firmware (OVMF) image | dstack OS image version |
| RTMR0    | Hardware and boot policy config | vCPU count, memory, GPU count |
| RTMR1    | Linux kernel binary | dstack image build |
| RTMR2    | Kernel cmdline, initrd, rootfs | rootfs config per deployment |
| RTMR3    | Runtime events (compose hash, etc.) | Already verified via event log replay |

Without measurement allowlists, teep verifies the TDX quote structure and
application-layer bindings (compose file, nonce, TLS key) but cannot confirm
that the lower stack (firmware, kernel, rootfs) matches expected values. A
malicious lower stack could preserve application-layer metadata while running
different code.

Measurement allowlists close this gap by requiring that each register contains
one of a known set of values.

## Quickstart

### 1. Bootstrap allowlists from observed values

Run verification against each provider and model, saving observed measurements
to your config file:

```sh
export TEEP_CONFIG=~/.config/teep/config.toml

# First model adds initial values
teep verify venice --model e2ee-qwen3-32b --update-config

# Additional models append and deduplicate
teep verify venice --model e2ee-deepseek-r1-0528 --update-config
teep verify neardirect --model qwen2.5-72b-instruct --update-config
```

Each invocation:
- Fetches attestation and runs all verification factors
- Extracts MRSEAM, MRTD, and RTMR0-2 from the TDX quote and event log
- Appends new values to `[providers.X.policy]` in the config, deduplicating
- Creates a `.bak` backup of the original config

To write to a different file instead of `$TEEP_CONFIG`:

```sh
teep verify venice --model e2ee-qwen3-32b --config-out ./teep.toml
```

### 2. Cross-check values

Before deploying, verify that the observed values match canonical sources (see
[Canonical Value Sources](#canonical-value-sources) below). Observed values are
trustworthy only when they can be independently reproduced or verified.

### 3. Deploy

Once satisfied, ensure your proxy uses the config:

```sh
export TEEP_CONFIG=~/.config/teep/config.toml
teep serve venice
```

The proxy merges Go-coded defaults, global TOML policy, and per-provider TOML
policy (most specific wins) to produce the final allowlist for each provider.

## Configuration Reference

### Global policy

Applies to all providers that do not have a per-provider policy section:

```toml
[policy]
mrseam_allow = [
  "49b66faa451d19ebbdbe89371b8daf2b65aa3984ec90110343e9e2eec116af08850fa20e3b1aa9a874d77a65380ee7e6",
  "7bf063280e94fb051f5dd7b1fc59ce9aac42bb961df8d44b709c9b0ff87a7b4df648657ba6d1189589feab1d5a3c9a9d",
]
mrtd_allow = [
  "b24d3b24e9e3c16012376b52362ca09856c4adecb709d5fac33addf1c47e193da075b125b6c364115771390a5461e217",
]
```

### Per-provider policy

Overrides global policy for a specific provider:

```toml
[providers.venice.policy]
mrseam_allow = [
  "49b66faa451d19ebbdbe89371b8daf2b65aa3984ec90110343e9e2eec116af08850fa20e3b1aa9a874d77a65380ee7e6",
]
mrtd_allow = [
  "b24d3b24e9e3c16012376b52362ca09856c4adecb709d5fac33addf1c47e193da075b125b6c364115771390a5461e217",
]
rtmr0_allow = [
  "0cb94dba1a9773d741efad49370e1e909557409a904a24a4620b6305651360952cb8111f851b03fc2a35a6c3b7bb05f6",
]
rtmr1_allow = [
  "c0445b704e4c4813a1a855d6aa2504bfe2c8f4f06d2c4df70cd655c64c7b92e13cfbafe91cf45d7e6e87db5b0bfb3d61",
]
rtmr2_allow = [
  "56462c01c59a66c998fa23e18f3d78fb56e24eb0293a64c65d15a080dd24d3b9c6a1e98c01dccd70b94e98f53c2f9a35",
]
```

### Gateway policy (nearcloud only)

For providers with a separate gateway CVM:

```toml
[providers.nearcloud.policy]
gateway_mrseam_allow = ["..."]
gateway_mrtd_allow = ["..."]
gateway_rtmr0_allow = ["..."]
gateway_rtmr1_allow = ["..."]
gateway_rtmr2_allow = ["..."]
```

### Merge order

Each allowlist field is resolved independently using:

1. **Per-provider TOML** — if the field has values, use them
2. **Global TOML** — else if the global policy has values, use those
3. **Go-coded defaults** — else use the built-in defaults

## Measurement Enforcement Behavior

Teep's enforcement model is **strict**: for any measurement factor that is
configured with one or more allowed values and **not** listed in
`allow_fail`, a report whose value is not in that allowlist will cause
attestation to fail and the request to be blocked.

However, the built-in Go defaults (`DefaultAllowFail`) mark some
high-variability factors as *advisory* by default (for example,
`tee_hardware_config`, `tee_boot_config`, and their gateway equivalents).
When a factor is in `allow_fail`, a mismatch is recorded and surfaced as a
warning, but does not by itself block the request. Factors not listed in
`allow_fail` are strictly enforced and any mismatch is a hard failure. To
enforce RTMR-related factors, remove them from `allow_fail` in your
configuration (setting `allow_fail = []` enforces all factors).

The `--update-config` flag helps populate or refresh measurement allowlists
from observed reports. It writes the discovered values into the appropriate
configuration file(s) using the precedence described above. It does **not**
toggle any warn-only mode; enforcement behavior is controlled solely by which
factors are configured and whether they are listed under `allow_fail`.

## Canonical Value Sources

### MRSEAM — Intel TDX Module

MRSEAM identifies the Intel TDX module version running on the host platform.
Values are deterministic per TDX module release and do not depend on the guest
image or provider.

**Primary source:** Intel publishes MRSEAM hashes in TDX module release notes:
- Repository: `github.com/intel/confidential-computing.tdx.tdx-module`
- Each release tag contains the MRSEAM hash for that version

**Secondary source:** Tinfoil maintains a curated list of accepted MRSEAM values:
- Repository: `github.com/tinfoilsh/tinfoil-python`

**Known values (as of this writing):**

| MRSEAM (truncated) | TDX Module | Platform |
|---------------------|------------|----------|
| `49b66faa451d19eb...` | 1.5.08 | Sapphire/Emerald Rapids |
| `7bf063280e94fb05...` | 1.5.16 | Sapphire/Emerald Rapids |
| `476a2997c62bccc7...` | 2.0.08 | Granite Rapids |
| `685f891ea5c20e8f...` | 2.0.02 | Granite Rapids |

A reasonable policy is to allow the set of non-deprecated module versions for
your target platform family. This does not require provider cooperation.

### MRTD — Virtual Firmware Image

MRTD measures the TD virtual firmware image (OVMF). It is deterministic for a
given dstack OS image version and does not vary with CPU count, memory, GPU
count, or provider.

**Compute from source:**

```sh
# Clone the dstack repository
git clone https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack
cd dstack

# Compute MRTD for a specific dstack release
dstack-mr measure
```

**Reproducible builds:**
- `github.com/Dstack-TEE/meta-dstack` — upstream reproducible build system
- `github.com/nearai/private-ml-sdk` — Near's dstack image builds

**Reference documentation:**
- Atlas `BOOTCHAIN-VERIFICATION.md` documents how MRTD is derived from the
  OVMF binary in the dstack image

**Known values:**

| MRTD (truncated) | dstack Version |
|-------------------|---------------|
| `b24d3b24e9e3c160...` | dstack-nvidia-0.5.4.1 |
| `f06dfda6dce1cf90...` | dstack-nvidia-0.5.5 |

### RTMR0 — Hardware Configuration

RTMR0 measures the virtual hardware configuration: vCPU count, memory size,
GPU count, PCI hole size, NVSwitch count, hotplug capability, and QEMU version.

**This register varies per deployment class.** A provider running models on
different hardware configurations will produce different RTMR0 values.

**Compute with known hardware params:**

```sh
dstack-mr measure --cpu N --memory SIZE --num-gpus G
```

Requires knowing the exact hardware configuration, which providers should
publish per deployment class.

**If hardware params are unknown:** Pin observed values using
`teep verify --update-config`. The pinned values will detect unexpected
changes but cannot be independently verified without hardware specs.

### RTMR1 — Kernel and Boot Loader

RTMR1 measures the Linux kernel binary loaded during boot. It is deterministic
for a given dstack image build.

**Compute from source:**

```sh
dstack-mr measure  # from github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack
```

Multiple values may exist across a provider's fleet if different dstack image
versions are deployed simultaneously (e.g., during rolling updates).

### RTMR2 — Root Filesystem and Command Line

RTMR2 measures the kernel command line, initrd, and root filesystem state.
Like RTMR0, it varies per deployment class.

**Compute from source:**

```sh
dstack-mr measure  # from github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack
```

**If deployment config is unknown:** Pin observed values using
`teep verify --update-config`.

### RTMR3 — Runtime Events

RTMR3 is computed by the dstack runtime from the compose hash, instance ID,
key provider identity, and other runtime events. Teep already verifies RTMR3
by replaying the event log (`event_log_integrity` factor). No manual pinning
is needed.

## Security Considerations

### Observed values are not proofs

Bootstrapping allowlists from observed values (`--update-config`) detects
measurement drift but does not constitute proof that the observed values are
correct. An attacker who controls the environment during initial observation
could cause teep to pin malicious values.

For maximum assurance:
1. Observe values from multiple independent vantage points
2. Cross-check MRSEAM against Intel's published release notes
3. Reproduce MRTD and RTMR1 from source using `dstack-mr measure`
4. Require providers to publish authenticated measurement manifests

### Rolling updates

When a provider updates their dstack image, firmware, or kernel version, the
corresponding measurement values change. During a rolling update, both old and
new values may appear in attestation responses.

Recommended approach:
1. Before the update, add the new expected values to your allowlists
2. After the rollout completes, remove the old values
3. If unexpected values appear and are not covered by an `allow_fail` rule,
   the allowlist enforcement will block requests; mismatches that are
   explicitly listed in `allow_fail` will be treated as warnings
   instead of hard failures.

### Fail-closed enforcement

By default, when a measurement value is not in the allowlist, the
corresponding verification factor fails and the proxy blocks the request.
This is the intended behavior for production deployments.

If all values in the fleet are unknown, you can temporarily configure
`allow_fail` for the relevant measurement checks to observe real-world
values, pin and cross-check them, and then remove those `allow_fail` entries
to switch back to strict enforcement.

## Tinfoil Providers (SEV-SNP)

Tinfoil providers (`tinfoil_v3_cloud` and `tinfoil_v3_direct`) run on AMD
SEV-SNP, not Intel TDX. The measurement model is different:

| Register | Measures |
|----------|----------|
| MEASUREMENT (48 bytes) | Launch digest of the guest firmware + kernel + initrd |
| GUEST_POLICY (8 bytes) | Guest platform policy (debug, migration, SMT, etc.) |
| TCB SVN (16 bytes) | Platform TCB version (bootloader, TEE, SNP, microcode) |

### Code Measurement Verification

Tinfoil uses Sigstore DSSE bundles to publish expected code measurements.
Teep verifies these automatically via the `sigstore_code_verified` factor:

1. Resolve the model's Sigstore repo (e.g. `tinfoilsh/confidential-llama3-3-70b`)
2. Fetch the latest release tag and `tinfoil.hash` artifact
3. Fetch the GitHub attestation for that digest
4. Verify the DSSE bundle signature and extract the code measurement
5. Compare against the live enclave's SEV-SNP MEASUREMENT register

No manual allowlist configuration is needed for Tinfoil — the Sigstore chain
provides the canonical measurement values. If the Sigstore-published hash
does not match the running enclave, `tee_measurement` and
`sigstore_code_verified` both fail.

### MR_SEAM Equivalent

SEV-SNP does not have an MR_SEAM register. The platform TCB version
(bootloader, TEE, SNP, and microcode SVN components) serves a similar role
and is verified by the `tee_tcb_current` factor against hardcoded minimums.

### Per-Provider Configuration

No per-provider measurement policy is needed for Tinfoil. The verification
factors use Sigstore for code measurements and hardcoded TCB minimums for
platform version checks.
