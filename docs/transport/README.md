# HTTP and TLS transport

This reference defines the transport requirements for provider implementations
and changes to shared HTTP clients. Read it with the security rules in
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and the
[attestation architecture](../../README_ADVANCED.md).

- [Retry contracts](retries.md): when the client may repeat an inference request.
- [Redirect policy](redirects.md): outbound clients and response handling.
- [Transport testing](testing.md): provider migrations and Go upgrades.

## Reuse goals

Reducing attestation overhead is a main goal of HTTP/2 support and the shared
authorization store. Reuse valid attestation results across requests and
preserve authenticated connections so concurrent clients can share them.
HTTP/2 multiplexing reduces connection setup and repeated TLS, certificate,
and CT checks. Authorization caching avoids repeated full attestation;
HTTP/2 alone does not change when attestation is required. Per-request
authorization checks and encryption remain required.

Connection lifetime and authorization lifetime are independent. One valid
authorization can cover multiple connections. A preserved connection can
serve successive authorizations when its attested transport identity remains
the same. Neither form of reuse extends authenticated evidence validity.

## Shared requirements

Every inference request must use a currently valid attestation for its
provider, model or route, cryptographic identity, and key epoch. On a cache
miss, the request handler must start or join verification. Failed enforced
factors block transmission. The existing explicit policy controls remain the
only exceptions; a transport change must not introduce an additional
exception.

Every inference TLS handshake requires TLS 1.3, system WebPKI validation, and
Certificate Transparency (CT) validation before the client sends request
bytes. For TLS-SPKI binding, the client must also compare the peer's SPKI with
the attested fingerprint during the handshake. A comparison after receiving
the response is too late to protect request data. SPKI comparisons use
constant-time operations. TLS-SPKI pools disable session resumption to ensure
that each handshake checks the attested peer identity.

For E2EE routes, every logical request must acquire a valid authorization that
binds the backend encryption key through attestation, including requests that
reuse relay TLS connections. A cached authorization satisfies this requirement;
the request does not need to perform full attestation again while it is valid.
Relay connection reuse does not extend the lifetime of a backend
authorization. NEAR cloud also attests its gateway: the gateway SPKI
identifies the TLS peer; the model backend fingerprint is separate evidence.

## Routes and authorizations

Resolve an immutable request route before verification or encryption. Do not
change a shared provider's endpoint while another request can use it.
Discovery must reject ambiguous model mappings. Authorization identity
includes provider, model, and route authority. Tinfoil cloud is the exception:
its evidence authenticates a model-independent router, so models share one
provider-and-authority authorization generation. Transport identity includes
the canonical HTTPS authority and attested SPKI.

Discovery refreshes share bounded work. A delayed caller rechecks whether a
fresh mapping was published after its initial lookup before starting another
refresh. A failed required refresh does not authorize use of a stale mapping.

The shared authorization store publishes the report, encryption key, transport
identity, and authenticated expiry together. Never maintain an independent pin
cache whose lifetime can differ from the report or encryption key. Derive
expiry from verified evidence, not a provider assertion or an arbitrary local
TTL. If evidence has no time bound, apply the verification policy without
inventing an authenticated expiry.
[The verifier patch notes](../../third_party/go-tdx-guest/TEEP_PATCH.md)
describe the Intel collateral rules. Online SEV-SNP verification also bounds
authorization by the earliest expiration of the verified VCEK or VLEK and the
applicable embedded AMD intermediate and root certificates. Untrusted supplied
ASK/ARK dates do not set this bound. Backend and gateway bounds both apply
when their certificate-chain and signature factors pass.

Concurrent requests for the same authorization join shared verification.
Tinfoil cloud shares verification, expiry, negative caching, and conditional
invalidation across models on the same router. Returned reports name the
requested model; successful E2EE outcomes remain specific to that model.
The store retains at most 1,000 model report views per router. Evicting a view
discards its diagnostic E2EE outcome without discarding router authorization
or triggering attestation.

The server owns the context for shared verification and limits its duration.
Cancellation of one waiting client does not cancel work needed by other
clients. Recheck expiry and invalidation before publishing a result. A stale
request may remove or update only the generation it used, never a replacement
published by another request. Tinfoil trusted-root metadata and target
downloads inherit the verification context, including response body reads.

The caller deadline and any authenticated expiry limit each inference attempt.
These bounds also apply while waiting for a connection, processing buffered
response data, and writing to the client. Response writers must support
`SetWriteDeadline`, either directly or through an `Unwrap` method that exposes
the HTTP server writer. A response that reaches its deadline cannot promote
the authorization report to E2EE success. Eviction prevents later acquisition
of stale authorization. Retire
only pools whose trust depends on the affected identity. Client cancellation
and ordinary I/O errors do not invalidate shared authorization; authentication
failures do. See
[the decision table](retries.md#retry-and-invalidation-decisions).

Implementation: [routes](../../internal/provider/route.go),
[authorization store](../../internal/proxy/authorization.go),
[route verification](../../internal/proxy/authorized_route.go), and
[transport identity](../../internal/tlsct/identity.go).

### Cached report selection

`GET /v1/tee/report` requires `provider` and `model`. For a TLS-bound provider,
add `authority` with a host and optional port to select that exact cached
scope, for example `authority=backend.example:8443`. This lookup performs no
discovery or attestation and returns 404 when the authorization is absent,
expired, or invalidated. Each parameter accepts one value; URLs, paths, and
credentials are invalid authority values.

Without `authority`, the proxy resolves the default route. Tinfoil direct
inference can select another backend from `prompt_cache_key`; use that
request's resolved authority to retrieve its report. The default lookup does
not identify which backend a previous sticky request selected.

### Response completion

Non-streaming HTTP 200 responses accept at most 10 MiB. NEAR chat reassembly
also bounds the encrypted SSE input to 32 MiB, including comments and framing.
This bounds accumulated content and tool arguments before final JSON encoding.
The relay reads one extra byte to distinguish an exact-limit response from truncation at the limit,
and fails
before reporting success if the response exceeds the bound or a required
frame cannot be authenticated. Oversize alone does not invalidate shared
authorization. Fully decrypted EHBP responses retain the upstream media type,
including audio responses.

### When full attestation repeats

For a stable provider, model, and authority, concurrent clients share a cached
authorization within one proxy server. Tinfoil cloud also shares it across
models on the same router authority. After the initial verification,
successful requests do not renew its lifetime or require full attestation.

| Event | Effect on attestation reuse |
|---|---|
| Authenticated evidence expires | The next acquisition requires full verification, even if a connection remains open. The interval depends on the verified evidence, not a fixed local TTL. Without an authenticated expiry, cache age alone does not force renewal. |
| Routing selects an authority without a cached authorization | Full verification is required for that authority. A single model can use multiple authorities; Tinfoil direct can select different backends for different `prompt_cache_key` values. Discovery refresh with the same authority does not force renewal. |
| A TLS trust failure, recognized encryption-key rejection, or response authentication failure invalidates authorization | A subsequent attempt requires full verification. Invalidation applies only to the generation used by the failed request; retry eligibility follows the [retry contract](retries.md#retry-and-invalidation-decisions). |
| Authorization is evicted, or a new proxy server starts | Full verification is required on a cache miss. Authorization caches are not shared across server instances. |
| Verification fails | No successful authorization is available to reuse. A later request can attempt verification after the negative-cache delay. |

Opening another connection for concurrency, reconnecting after idle timeout
or server closure, and closing or evicting a connection pool do not themselves
require full attestation. Each new TLS connection must pass the handshake
checks against the currently authorized identity. Ordinary network errors,
client cancellation, and local connection-capacity rejection retain valid
authorization. See the retry contract for error classification.

## Connection reuse and resource limits

Prefer HTTP/2 multiplexing. HTTP/1.1 peers may reuse connections sequentially
under the same trust constraints. Do not set `Connection: close` per request;
HTTP/2 forbids the header. Closing one response stream must not terminate
other requests on its connection.

The pool registry selects pinned pools by provider, authority, and attested
SPKI. Models may share a pool only when that transport identity is the same;
each request still needs its own applicable authorization. A pool identified
only by hostname cannot distinguish attestation epochs. Keep mutable TLS
configuration separate for each provider.

Use the common transport and client constructors. The client constructors
install TLS, CT, and redirect policy; `NewPooledTransport` alone is not a
fully authenticated client. Environment proxy selection (`HTTPS_PROXY` and
`NO_PROXY`) remains enabled. A pinned client selects the proxy once for its
attested origin. For HTTPS proxies, a separate TLS configuration authenticates
the proxy with TLS 1.3, system WebPKI, and CT before CONNECT is sent. Go then
performs CONNECT and the origin TLS handshake, including the attested SPKI
check. Each TLS handshake has its own setup budget. Origin HTTP/2 pooling and
physical socket limits also apply through a proxy.

The common transport separately bounds physical sockets because Go's HTTP/2
accounting can stop counting a live connection against `MaxConnsPerHost` when
the connection reaches its stream limit. Each socket holds its permit until
close. This is a resource bound, separate from authorization and stream
concurrency. A dial that cannot acquire a socket permit returns
`tlsct.ErrConnectionCapacity` immediately. Inference reports HTTP 503 with `Retry-After: 1`, retains
its authorization, and does not retry. Attestation clients also return this
local capacity error without retry. When an attestation fetch exhausts socket
capacity, authorization acquisition preserves that error and returns the same
503/backoff response without negative caching it. A later request can attempt
full verification as soon as capacity is available. Existing streams continue;
subsequent requests can reuse their connections when stream capacity becomes
available.
The one-second delay is backoff advice, not a prediction of available capacity.
Clients should respect it and use increasing delays with jitter for repeated
overload responses. [HTTP 503](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-15.6.4)
describes shared service capacity; [HTTP 429](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6585.html#section-4)
would describe a client rate limit, which this transport does not impose.
HTTP/1.1 requests can still wait in Go's connection queue under their deadlines.

Do not enable `http.HTTP2Config.StrictMaxConcurrentRequests` as a substitute
for this overload handling. A local regression reproduced a reservation-count
deadlock in Go 1.26.0, 1.26.8, 1.27.0, and 1.27.1. In strict mode, queued
requests reserve a connection. The first waiter holds `reqHeaderMu` while
`awaitOpenSlotForStreamLocked` counts the other reservations as occupied
streams. Those requests cannot advance past that lock to release their
reservations, even after active streams finish. Non-strict mode permits
connection expansion; rejecting exhausted socket permits avoids a second wait
that stream completion cannot release. No Go or HTTP/2 dependency patch is
required. Reassess strict mode only with regression coverage for queued
requests resuming after active streams finish.

Each pool currently permits 16 physical connections per dial address and 10
idle connections per host. The idle timeout is 90 seconds. TCP dialing and TLS
handshakes each have a separate five-minute time limit. Shared full
verification admits 16 concurrent operations. These values are implementation
settings, not cryptographic guarantees or a global provider connection limit.
Earlier request and evidence deadlines still apply. Change limits with the
corresponding concurrency tests. If a peer advertises 128 streams per connection,
16 connections provide a nominal 2,048 simultaneous streams per pool. This is
not an admission guarantee: retiring sockets, pending dials, and peer settings
can cause exhaustion earlier. Models sharing a pool share its capacity.
The inbound `max_conns` setting does not change these outbound limits.

Implementation: [common transport](../../internal/tlsct/pooled.go),
[physical socket limits](../../internal/tlsct/connection_budget.go),
[TLS clients](../../internal/tlsct/transport.go),
[pinned TLS checks](../../internal/tlsct/pinned.go),
[HTTPS proxy authentication](../../internal/tlsct/pinned_proxy.go), and
[pool management](../../internal/proxy/pinned_upstream.go).

## Request and response ownership

Proxy and standalone verification share request encryption, headers, framing,
evidence deadlines, and session cleanup. Use
[`PrepareInference`](../../internal/provider/inference.go),
[`InferenceContext`](../../internal/tlsct/inference_retry.go), and
[`ZeroSessions`](../../internal/e2ee/session.go) for each provider. Each retry
creates a fresh encryption session. Encrypted inference requests have
`GetBody == nil` to prevent transparent transport replay.

The attempt owner closes the original HTTP response body exactly once and
clears ephemeral session material on every exit path. A decryption reader has
its own cleanup; it must not replace the owned HTTP body. A parser that
consumes and closes a response body must install the replacement body before
returning, including on errors. Authenticate encrypted error responses before
interpreting their content. Never log request bodies, response bodies, or
encryption keys.

EHBP response EOF is valid only at a frame boundary after at least one
authenticated frame. Empty encrypted responses and partial frame headers fail
the request and cannot promote E2EE success. Transport read failures retain
authorization, including during NEAR non-streaming response reassembly;
cryptographic failures conditionally invalidate the generation used.
An SSE `[DONE]` marker does not establish EHBP frame completion. Streaming
relay, SSE reassembly, and standalone EHBP verification read the remaining
stream through the same scanner before accepting completion. Only bounded
empty lines and comments may follow `[DONE]` (64 KiB of scanned lines).
Trailing data, partial frames, authentication failures, and read failures
fail the request. The relay does not send `[DONE]` or promote E2EE success
until completion succeeds. Existing request and authenticated evidence
deadlines also bound this final read.

Metrics and reports must describe the route and authorization the request
used. Accumulate phase durations across attempts and include the resolved
authority in model metrics. Do not perform another discovery or authorization
lookup solely to label the completed request.

Callers that embed the proxy in another HTTP server must call `Server.Close`
to cancel shared verification and close idle inference, attestation, model
discovery, endpoint discovery, and nonce-fetch connections. Provider components
forward cleanup to their owned clients and resolvers, including wrapped model
listers. Active inference streams may finish under their existing deadlines.
Configure injected clients before concurrent use or cleanup.

Transport wrappers, including retry and capture wrappers, must forward
`CloseIdleConnections` to their underlying pools so client cleanup remains
effective. Standalone verification closes clients it creates; callers retain
ownership of injected clients. Per-operation Sigstore clients also close
idle connections when verification ends.

## Current provider coverage

| Providers | Channel binding | Authorization and inference path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NEAR direct | Attested TLS SPKI and NEAR request encryption | Immutable route, atomic authorization, shared pinned HTTP transport |
| NEAR cloud | Attested gateway TLS SPKI plus backend encryption key | Immutable gateway route, gateway and backend verification, atomic authorization, shared pinned HTTP transport |
| Tinfoil direct and cloud | Attested TLS SPKI and EHBP encryption key | Immutable route, atomic authorization, shared pinned HTTP transport |
| Other providers | Provider-specific attestation and E2EE mechanisms | Existing generic verification and cache path; does not use the atomic authorization implementation above |

EHBP request and response handling belongs to the authorized inference path;
the generic path rejects streaming request encryption.

TLS-binding providers use the authorized inference path, which selects a pinned
pool from the acquired authorization's transport identity. The generic send
path serves providers without TLS binding and has no separate pin lookup or
TLS-binding invalidation path. The handshake authenticates the SPKI; response
handling does not repeat that check after transmission.

All providers must satisfy the shared requirements. For a provider migration,
identify its TLS peer, backend key, route scope, and validity sources first.
Reuse the shared implementation where those contracts apply. Add a
provider-specific behavior only with an explicit contract and regression
coverage. Update these documents and their linked tests in the same change as
any transport behavior change.
