# Inference retry contracts

The shared proxy and standalone inference loop permits at most two attempts
(one retry) under one caller deadline. Each attempt obtains valid
authorization and creates a fresh encryption session. Clean up the rejected
attempt before starting the next one. An HTTP error alone does not prove that
the provider did not process inference.

## Retry and invalidation decisions

| Outcome | Retry this request? | Shared authorization action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typed DNS error marked temporary or timed out, or a dial error, before any `GotConn` | At most once, if the context remains valid | Retain; acquire valid authorization again |
| Exact supported key rejection before inference | At most once | Conditionally remove the generation used; acquire authorization again |
| TLS WebPKI, CT, or SPKI authentication failure | No | Conditionally remove the generation used |
| Response authentication, decryption, or encryption-policy failure | No | Conditionally remove the generation used |
| Cancellation, deadline, ordinary I/O failure, ambiguous EOF or connection reset, or protocol error after connection assignment | No | Retain; normal expiry still applies |
| Local outbound socket capacity exhausted | No | Retain; return HTTP 503 with `Retry-After: 1` before response headers |
| Redirect, generic service error, or malformed rejection envelope | No | No invalidation solely for this outcome |

Malformed JSON, invalid SSE structure, and response size limits fail the
request without invalidating authorization. Only an authentication,
decryption, or encryption-policy failure uses the decryption-failure
classification. Re-attestation cannot repair an ordinary response schema
error. NEAR non-streaming SSE reassembly decrypts each delta once and uses
that same result for content and tool-call metadata.

The attempt records whether the transport assigned a connection at any point,
including during internal transport activity. Do not classify errors by text
or infer replay safety from an EOF. `GetBody` remains nil for encrypted
inference requests: successful HTTP/2 negotiation must not enable automatic
replay of a POST whose body the transport already consumed.

Implementation:
[attempt classification and loop](../../internal/tlsct/inference_retry.go),
[proxy attempts](../../internal/proxy/authorized_inference.go), and
[rejection parsing](../../internal/provider/key_rejection.go).

## Recognized provider responses

All responses below arrive over attested TLS. NEAR responses require HTTP 400,
media type `application/json`, and the exact message `Decryption failed`.
Key recovery applies only when the attempt used an E2EE session. A TLS-only
request handles the same envelope as an ordinary upstream error: it does not
invalidate authorization or retry.

| Provider | Endpoint under `/v1/` | Required `error.type` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NEAR direct | `chat/completions`, `embeddings`, `images/generations`, `rerank`, `score` | `bad_request` |
| NEAR cloud | `chat/completions` | `invalid_request_error` |
| NEAR cloud | `embeddings` | `provider_error` |
| NEAR cloud | `images/generations`, `rerank`, `score` | No recognized retry contract |

Tinfoil direct and cloud require HTTP 422, media type
`application/problem+json`, and problem `type` exactly
`urn:ietf:params:ehbp:error:key-config`.

The presence of `Ehbp-Response-Nonce`, including an empty value, excludes the
response from plaintext rejection parsing. The client must authenticate
encrypted HTTP 422 and 500 responses through the normal response processing
path. These responses do not authorize replay. The client rejects an empty
nonce.

The parser uses strict validation and a 64 KiB size limit. It returns an error
for unknown fields, missing required fields, invalid JSON, or an invalid
content type in a candidate rejection response. It also returns an error if
the body exceeds the size limit or cannot be read. A well-formed response with
another type or message is not a key rejection. Do not search raw body strings
or recursively parse nested error text to expand these contracts.

## NEAR contract evidence

The contract review used these source revisions:

- [inference-proxy at `43bb027f`](https://github.com/nearai/inference-proxy/tree/43bb027f064b400a0613673e339041e98d7919b3):
  `src/routes/chat.rs` calls `decrypt_request_fields` before dispatch.
  `src/routes/passthrough.rs` uses the same operation in
  `json_passthrough_encrypted` before upstream calls. `src/encryption.rs` and
  `src/error.rs` map decryption failure to `AppError::BadRequest`.
- [cloud-api at `07798f89`](https://github.com/nearai/cloud-api/tree/07798f899accaf519dae0d572913c86aa31c4622):
  `crates/inference_providers/src/attested/nearai/mod.rs` extracts backend error
  messages. `crates/services/src/completions/mod.rs` maps chat HTTP 400 to
  `InvalidParams`; `crates/api/src/conversions.rs` emits `invalid_request_error`.
  The embeddings service preserves `CompletionError::ProviderError`, which
  emits `provider_error`. Image, rerank, and score retain raw backend response
  strings and do not establish the same outer JSON response contract.

A provider protocol change requires new evidence and tests before changing the
recognizer. Keep the exact accepted response and endpoint set visible here.
