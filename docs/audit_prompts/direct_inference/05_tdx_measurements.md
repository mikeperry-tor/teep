## What Each Register Measures

Understanding the security semantics of each register is critical for assessing attestation completeness. The following describes the trust-chain role of each register, based on Intel TDX architecture and the dstack CVM implementation used by inference providers:

**MRSEAM** — Measurement of the TDX module (SEAM firmware). This 48-byte hash represents the identity and integrity of the Intel TDX module running in Secure Arbitration Mode. Intel signs and guarantees TDX module integrity; the MRSEAM value should correspond to a known Intel-released TDX module version. Verification of MRSEAM ensures the TDX firmware has not been tampered with and is a recognised, trusted version. Without MRSEAM verification, an attacker who compromises the hypervisor could potentially load a modified TDX module that subverts TD isolation guarantees.

**MRTD** — Measurement Register for Trust Domain. This 48-byte hash captures the initial memory contents and configuration of the TD at creation time, specifically the virtual firmware (OVMF/TDVF) measurement. MRTD is measured by the TDX module in SEAM mode before any guest code executes, making it the root-of-trust anchor for the entire guest boot chain. In dstack's architecture, MRTD corresponds to TPM PCR[0] (FirmwareCode). MRTD can be pre-calculated from the built dstack OS image. Without MRTD verification, an attacker could substitute a different virtual firmware (e.g., one that leaks secrets or skips subsequent measured boot steps) while preserving the correct compose hash and RTMR3 values.

**RTMR0** — Runtime firmware configuration measurement. RTMR0 records the CVM's virtual hardware setup as measured by OVMF, including CPU count, memory size, device configuration, secure boot policy variables (PK, KEK, db, dbx), boot variables, and TdHob/CFV data provided by the VMM. Corresponds to TPM PCR[1,7]. While dstack uses fixed devices, CPU and memory specifications can vary, so RTMR0 can be computed from the dstack image given specific CPU and RAM parameters. Without RTMR0 verification, a malicious VMM could alter the virtual hardware configuration (e.g., inject rogue devices or disable secure boot) without detection.

**RTMR1** — Runtime OS loader measurement. RTMR1 records the Linux kernel measurement as extended by OVMF, along with the GPT partition table and boot loader (shim/grub) code. Corresponds to TPM PCR[2,3,4,5]. RTMR1 can be pre-calculated from the built dstack OS image. Without RTMR1 verification, a modified kernel could be loaded that bypasses security controls while leaving application-level measurements intact.

**RTMR2** — Runtime OS component measurement. RTMR2 records the kernel command line (including the rootfs hash), initrd binary, and grub configuration/modules as measured by the boot loader. Corresponds to TPM PCR[8-15]. RTMR2 can be pre-calculated from the built dstack OS image. Without RTMR2 verification, the kernel command line could be altered (e.g., to disable security features or change the root filesystem hash) without detection.

**RTMR3** — Application-specific runtime measurement. In dstack's implementation, RTMR3 records application-level details including the compose hash, instance ID, app ID, and key provider. Unlike RTMR0-2, RTMR3 cannot be pre-calculated from the image alone because it contains runtime information. It is verified by replaying the event log: if replayed RTMR3 matches the quoted RTMR3, the event log content is authentic, and the compose hash, key provider, and other details can be extracted and verified from the event log entries. The existing compose binding check (MRConfigID) partially overlaps with RTMR3 for compose hash verification.

## How Thorough Verification Should Work

For complete attestation of a dstack-based CVM, the verification process should:

1. **Obtain golden values**: The inference provider MUST publish reference values for MRTD, RTMR0, RTMR1, and RTMR2 corresponding to each released CVM image version. These values can be computed using reproducible build tooling (e.g., dstack's `dstack-mr` tool) from the source-built image given the specific CPU and RAM configuration of the deployment.

2. **Verify MRSEAM against Intel's published values**: MRSEAM should match a known Intel TDX module release. Intel publishes TDX module versions; the expected MRSEAM value can be derived from the specific TDX module version running on the platform.

3. **Verify MRTD, RTMR0, RTMR1, RTMR2 against golden values**: These four registers, taken together, attest that the firmware, kernel, initrd, rootfs, and boot configuration all match the expected dstack OS image for the provider's declared CPU/RAM configuration. This is the only way to establish that the base operating environment is the expected one.

4. **Verify RTMR3 via event log replay**: RTMR3 contains runtime-specific measurements that cannot be pre-calculated. Replay the event log, compare the replayed RTMR3 against the quoted value, and then inspect the event log entries for expected compose hash, app ID, and key provider values.

5. **Verify MRSEAM + MRTD + RTMR0-2 as a set**: These five values together form a complete chain-of-trust from the TDX module through firmware, kernel, and OS components. Verifying only a subset (e.g., only compose binding via MRConfigID + RTMR3 event log replay) leaves significant gaps where the base system could be substituted.

## Current Stopgaps and Residual Gaps

The code supports an allowlist-based `MeasurementPolicy` for MRTD, MRSEAM, and RTMR0-3. The direct inference provider (neardirect / NEAR AI) does not publish authenticated measurement baselines in-band, but teep now provides Go-coded stopgap defaults and operator tooling to partially close this gap:

**MRSEAM — Go-coded defaults from Intel releases.** `DstackBaseMeasurementPolicy()` in `internal/attestation/dstack_defaults.go` ships an allowlist of four Intel-published MRSEAM values corresponding to TDX module versions 1.5.08, 1.5.16, 2.0.08, and 2.0.02. These are sourced from Intel's official release notes. The `tee_measurement` factor is enforced by default for neardirect (it is NOT in `NeardirectDefaultAllowFail`).

**MRTD — Go-coded defaults from dstack reproducible builds.** The same base policy ships two MRTD values corresponding to dstack-nvidia image versions 0.5.4.1 and 0.5.5, derived from reproducible build artifacts.

**RTMR0, RTMR1, RTMR2 — Per-provider observed-value defaults.** `DefaultMeasurementPolicy()` in `internal/provider/neardirect/policy.go` provides observed RTMR0-2 values. These are pinned from verified attestation sessions and serve as a detection mechanism — a change in these values triggers an alert. The `tee_hardware_config` (RTMR0) and `tee_boot_config` (RTMR1/RTMR2) factors are in `NeardirectDefaultAllowFail` — meaning they are computed and reported but do not block traffic by default.

**Measurement policy merge.** Policies are resolved via a three-tier precedence: per-provider TOML config → global TOML config → Go-coded defaults, implemented in `MergedMeasurementPolicy()` in `internal/config/config.go`.

**Operator bootstrapping.** The `teep verify <provider> --model <model> --update-config` command runs a full attestation verification and appends newly observed measurement values to the per-provider policy section.

**Residual risk.** Despite these stopgaps, the provider still does not publish authenticated measurement baselines in-band:
- MRSEAM and MRTD defaults are independently verifiable from Intel and dstack sources — these are the strongest stopgaps.
- RTMR0-2 defaults are pinned from observed attestation data and cannot distinguish a legitimate provider infrastructure change from a compromised lower stack.
- No signed measurement manifest exists for automated consumption.

**The audit MUST flag the remaining residual risk** and recommend that the inference provider publish authenticated measurement baselines. See `docs/attestation_gaps/dstack_integrity.md` for the detailed analysis.

## Current Direct-Provider Expectation Summary

- MRCONFIGID is expected to be cryptographically checked via compose binding,
- RTMR fields are expected to be consistency-checked via event log replay when event logs are present,
- REPORTDATA is expected to be cryptographically verified via the neardirect binding scheme (sha256(signing_address + tls_fingerprint) + nonce),
- MRSEAM and MRTD are enforced by default via Go-coded allowlists sourced from Intel TDX module releases and dstack reproducible builds — the `tee_measurement` factor is enforced (not in `NeardirectDefaultAllowFail`),
- RTMR0 is checked via `tee_hardware_config` against per-provider observed values — allowed to fail by default,
- RTMR1 and RTMR2 are checked via `tee_boot_config` against per-provider observed values — allowed to fail by default,
- MRSIGNERSEAM, MROWNER, MROWNERCONFIG are expected to be all-zeros for standard dstack deployments and should be documented as informational-only.

The audit MUST verify:
- how MRTD/MRSEAM/RTMR allowlists are configured (the three-tier merge in `MergedMeasurementPolicy()`),
- input validation rules for allowlist values (length/encoding),
- whether allowlist mismatches are enforced fail-closed or informational (depends on whether the factor is in `allow_fail`),
- the `--update-config` bootstrapping flow and its implications for initial deployment.

## Required Checks

### Field Extraction and Policy Verification

Verify and report:
- where each field is parsed and exposed in the verification report,
- whether expected-value policies exist for MRTD/MRSEAM/RTMR0-3,
- input validation for allowlist values (encoding/length/parse failures),
- mismatch behavior (fail-closed vs informational),
- whether fields expected to be all-zero in standard dstack deployments (MRSIGNERSEAM, MROWNER, MROWNERCONFIG) are actually checked or only logged,
- whether MRCONFIGID and REPORTDATA controls are enforced elsewhere but correctly reflected here,
- that each 48-byte measurement field is validated for correct length upon extraction from the quote body (not silently truncated or zero-padded).

### RTMR Extension Semantics

The RTMR registers use an extend-only mechanism that is critical for understanding measurement integrity:
- extend formula: `RTMR_new = SHA-384(RTMR_old || digest)`, where `||` denotes concatenation,
- initial RTMR state: 48 zero bytes (all-zero starting value),
- hash algorithm: SHA-384 (producing 48-byte / 384-bit digests, matching TDX register width),
- the extend operation is one-way — once extended, an RTMR value cannot be reverted to a prior state.

The audit MUST verify that any code performing RTMR replay or comparison correctly implements these semantics. For RTMR3 event log replay specifically, verify that:
- short digests in event log entries are padded to 48 bytes before extension,
- the IMR index in each event log entry is validated to be within [0, 3],
- a malformed event log entry causes the entire replay to fail (not silently skipped).

### Measurement Policy Configuration

Verify and report how the `MeasurementPolicy` is structured and loaded:
- how allowlists are represented in code (slice of hex-encoded strings, slice of `[48]byte`, etc.),
- where `MeasurementPolicy` is instantiated and which caller configures it,
- whether allowlist population is static (compiled-in) or dynamic (config file, API response, environment variable),
- whether an empty allowlist means "skip check" (permissive) or "reject all" (restrictive) — this distinction is critical for fail-secure behavior,
- whether there is a mechanism for operators to add custom measurement allowlists without code changes,
- how allowlist entries are matched against quote values (exact match, prefix match, or set membership),
- whether the comparison is byte-level or string-level (hex canonicalization: lowercase vs uppercase, 0x prefix handling).

The audit MUST verify:
- how MRTD/MRSEAM/RTMR allowlists are configured via the three-tier merge (per-provider TOML > global TOML > Go defaults),
- that separate TOML fields exist for each measurement type (`mrtd_allow`, `mrseam_allow`, `rtmr0_allow`, etc.),
- input validation rules for allowlist values (length/encoding),
- whether allowlist mismatches are enforced fail-closed or informational (depends on whether the factor is in `allow_fail`),
- the `--update-config` bootstrapping flow and that it correctly captures observed measurements.

### Golden-Value Management Lifecycle

The audit MUST assess the lifecycle of golden/reference measurement values:
- **Acquisition**: How are golden values obtained? (reproducible build tooling, provider API, manual configuration)
- **Versioning**: How are golden values versioned when the CVM image is updated? Is there a grace period where both old and new values are accepted during rollouts?
- **Rotation**: How are stale golden values retired? Is there a mechanism to remove old values from the allowlist after a deployment upgrade completes?
- **Distribution**: How would updated golden values reach the teep verifier? (code update, config reload, API fetch)
- **Integrity**: How are golden values protected from tampering in transit and at rest? (signed manifests, pinned transport)

These questions apply both to the current state (where golden values are absent) and to the future state (when the provider publishes them).

### Relationship Between Measurements and Event Log

The audit MUST verify how measurement registers interact with event log verification:
- RTMR3 is verified by replaying the event log (see Section 06 — Event Log Integrity for replay details), while RTMR0-2 are verified against golden values (when available),
- the event log replay for RTMR3 is a consistency check (quoted value matches replayed value), not a policy check — the actual policy checks happen when inspecting individual event log entries (compose hash, app ID, key provider),
- MRCONFIGID is independently bound via compose hashing (see Section 08 — CVM Image Verification) and partially overlaps with RTMR3 compose hash verification,
- the audit MUST document which measurement registers are covered by which verification mechanism and identify any registers that have no verification path at all.

### TCB Level Evaluation and Measurement Context

TCB (Trusted Computing Base) level interacts with measurement verification:
- TCB level from PCS collateral determines whether the platform firmware and microcode are current,
- a non-UpToDate TCB status may indicate known vulnerabilities in the TDX module or platform firmware, which affects the trustworthiness of all measurement registers,
- verify whether TCB status evaluation is considered when interpreting measurement register values (e.g., a valid MRSEAM value on a Revoked TCB platform is not trustworthy),
- verify whether the code combines TCB status with measurement policy results into an overall trust decision, or whether they are evaluated independently.

## Mandatory Residual-Risk Analysis

You MUST explicitly evaluate the known baseline-publication gap:
- if provider golden values for MRSEAM/MRTD/RTMR0-2 are absent,
- whether these fields become informational-only,
- why this leaves system-level integrity gaps despite compose binding and RTMR3/event-log consistency checks.

You MUST quantify realistic attacker capability under this gap (for example, hypervisor-level substitution of firmware/kernel/initrd/rootfs while preserving application-layer bindings).

**The audit MUST recommend** that the inference provider publish:
1. The specific dstack OS version (or equivalent CVM image) and TDX module version used in their deployments,
2. Reproducible build instructions or source references for their CVM image,
3. Pre-computed golden values for MRTD, RTMR0, RTMR1, and RTMR2 for each supported CPU/RAM configuration,
4. The expected MRSEAM value for the Intel TDX module version deployed on their hardware,
5. A versioned manifest or API endpoint that maps deployment configurations to expected measurement values, so that verifiers like teep can populate `MeasurementPolicy` allowlists automatically.

See `docs/attestation_gaps/dstack_integrity.md` for the detailed analysis and recommended in-band publication model.

## Best-Practice Audit Points

### Go (Golang) Best Practices

- **Type safety for measurement values**: Verify that 48-byte measurement registers are represented as fixed-size arrays (`[48]byte`) rather than variable-length slices (`[]byte`) where possible, preventing length mismatches at compile time.
- **Hex encoding/decoding**: Verify that `encoding/hex` is used for converting measurement values to/from their hex string representations, and that `hex.DecodeString` errors are handled (reject malformed hex, not silently truncated).
- **Struct field access safety**: Verify that accessing measurement fields from parsed quote structures includes bounds checks or uses Go's type system to enforce correct sizes, preventing panics on malformed input.
- **Error context propagation**: Verify that measurement verification errors include the field name and expected/actual values (hex-encoded) for diagnostic purposes, while not leaking these in client-facing responses.
- **Interface usage for policy**: If `MeasurementPolicy` uses interfaces, verify that the interface contract is documented and that nil/zero-value implementations behave safely (e.g., an empty policy struct should not silently pass all checks unless explicitly designed to do so).
- **Map vs slice for allowlists**: If allowlists are represented as slices, verify that lookup is O(n) with small n, or that a map/set is used for larger allowlists. For security-critical comparisons, verify that the lookup does not short-circuit on first byte mismatch (timing side-channel).

### Cryptography Best Practices

- **Constant-time comparison for measurements**: Verify that measurement value comparisons against allowlists use `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` or iterate all entries without early exit, preventing timing side-channels that could reveal partial measurement values.
- **SHA-384 for RTMR extension**: Verify that RTMR replay uses `crypto/sha512.Sum384` (SHA-384 is a truncation of SHA-512) and not SHA-256 or another algorithm. A hash algorithm mismatch would produce incorrect replayed values that silently fail to match.
- **Hash collision resistance**: Document that SHA-384 provides 192-bit collision resistance, which is sufficient for measurement register integrity. No known practical attacks exist against SHA-384 collision resistance.
- **No measurement value truncation**: Verify that 48-byte measurement values are never truncated to shorter lengths for comparison (e.g., comparing only the first 32 bytes would weaken collision resistance).
- **Deterministic comparison**: Verify that measurement comparisons operate on canonical byte representations, not string representations that could differ in case or encoding.

### General Security Audit Practices

- **Trust boundary for measurement values**: Measurement values from the quote are cryptographically attested (after quote signature verification succeeds), but their interpretation depends on policy. Verify that no measurement-based security decisions are made before quote signature verification is complete.
- **Fail-secure for empty policy**: When no golden values are configured, the measurement check must be explicitly documented as "skipped due to no policy" rather than silently returning "pass." Verify that the verification report clearly distinguishes between "checked and matched" and "not checked."
- **Defense in depth across registers**: Verify that the code is structured to check all measurement registers independently, so that a bug in one register's check does not bypass checks on other registers.
- **Audit trail completeness**: Verify that all measurement register values (both expected and actual) are included in the verification report for offline forensic analysis, even for registers where no policy enforcement occurs.
- **Configuration injection prevention**: If measurement allowlists can be configured via external input (config files, environment variables), verify that the configuration parsing validates input format strictly (exact hex length, no whitespace, no wildcards/regex).
- **Rollback protection**: When golden values are updated (future state), verify whether the old values are immediately removed from the allowlist or whether a transition window exists. A too-long transition window could allow an attacker to roll back to a vulnerable CVM image that still matches an old allowlist entry.
