# Plan: MapleAI Provider Support

## TL;DR

Add MapleAI as a new teep provider. MapleAI runs LLM inference through an AWS Nitro
Enclave proxy at `https://enclave.trymaple.ai`, using COSE_Sign1 attestation documents
with ECDSA P-384 signatures chaining to the AWS Nitro root certificate, X25519 key
exchange, and ChaCha20-Poly1305 end-to-end encryption. This requires: a new Nitro
attestation parsing/verification library, generalized `tee_*` attestation factors, an
E2EE session implementation, provider wiring, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Architecture Decision: Non-Pinned with Session Caching

MapleAI's security model binds the E2EE key exchange to the attestation document: the
server's X25519 public key is embedded in the COSE_Sign1-signed attestation payload.
TLS pinning is unnecessary because:

- Nitro attestation documents do not include TLS certificate fingerprints
- E2EE provides equivalent channel security — only the attested enclave holds the
  X25519 private key corresponding to the `public_key` in the signed attestation doc
- The key exchange is cryptographically bound to the attestation via the signed
  `public_key` field

This matches the Chutes provider pattern (non-pinned, E2EE-secured) rather than
nearcloud/neardirect (TLS-pinned).

**Session lifecycle:**
- Attestation report cached per `(provider, model)` key with 1h TTL (existing
  `attestation.Cache`, already model-scoped via `cacheKey{provider, model}`)
- E2EE session `(session_id, session_key)` cached alongside attestation on the
  provider's E2EE struct, keyed by the attested `public_key`
- On session failure (HTTP 400, decryption error): re-attest + new key exchange
- On attestation cache miss/expiry: full attestation + key exchange

**Architecture:**
- MapleAI's backend at `enclave.trymaple.ai` serves all models from a single Nitro
  Enclave, so the X25519 public key is stable across models and requests within an
  enclave lifecycle
- The Nitro enclave acts as a router/proxy; actual inference runs on AMD SEV-SNP
  backends (Edgeless Privatemode AI, Tinfoil). Sidecar proxies inside the enclave
  verify backend attestation (Contrast SDK, tinfoil-go SDK) and re-encrypt or
  establish attested TLS before forwarding. This backend attestation is not exposed
  through the MapleAI Nitro attestation endpoint — it is a known gap
- A session key is generated per key exchange, tied to a server-issued `session_id`;
  the server may timeout sessions independently

## Authentication Chain Analysis

This section documents exactly what is and is not cryptographically authenticated in
the MapleAI attestation and encryption architecture. It maps trust boundaries, identifies
gaps relative to other teep providers, and specifies which checks the implementation
must enforce to maintain each authentication chain. An independent code agent must
understand these chains to know which verification steps are security-critical (must
never be weakened) versus defense-in-depth (valuable but not on the critical path).

### Chain 1: Enclave Identity (COSE_Sign1 → AWS Nitro Root)

**What it proves:** The code running inside the Nitro Enclave matches specific
measurements (PCR0/1/2), and the attestation document was produced by genuine AWS
Nitro hardware.

**Trust anchor:** AWS Nitro Attestation PKI root certificate (ECDSA P-384, 30-year
lifetime, published by AWS with a known SHA-256 fingerprint).

**Chain of authentication:**

```
AWS Nitro Root Certificate (embedded, byte-compared)
  └─ signs → Intermediate certificate(s) in cabundle
       └─ signs → Leaf certificate (from attestation payload)
            └─ signs → COSE_Sign1 Sig_structure (protected headers + payload)
                 └─ contains → Attestation payload:
                      ├─ pcrs: {0: <enclave image hash>, 1: <kernel hash>, 2: <app hash>}
                      ├─ public_key: <X25519 server public key, 32 bytes>
                      ├─ nonce: <client-generated UUID, anti-replay>
                      ├─ module_id: <enclave identifier>
                      └─ timestamp: <UTC milliseconds>
```

**Critical enforcement points (must never be weakened):**

1. **Root cert byte-identity**: `cabundle[0]` must be byte-identical to the embedded
   AWS Nitro root certificate DER. Do NOT use flexible X.509 subject matching — only
   exact byte comparison. This is the sole trust anchor.
2. **Full chain signature verification**: Every link in the chain (root → intermediates
   → leaf) must have its signature cryptographically verified. A missing or invalid
   intermediate breaks the entire chain.
3. **COSE_Sign1 signature verification**: The Sig_structure construction must follow
   RFC 9052 §4.4 exactly: `["Signature1", protected, b"", payload]`. An incorrect
   Sig_structure would verify against a tampered payload.
4. **Client-originated nonce**: The nonce in the attestation document must match the
   client-generated UUID. The client MUST generate the nonce locally via `crypto/rand`
   (not accept one from the server). Nonce mismatch → FAIL CLOSED. This prevents
   replay of old attestation documents.
5. **Certificate time validity**: All certificates in the chain must be checked for
   `NotBefore ≤ now ≤ NotAfter`. An expired certificate means the PKI no longer
   vouches for this key.
6. **Debug mode detection**: PCR0 all-zeros means the enclave is running in debug mode
   (AWS allows operator memory inspection). This MUST fail `tee_debug_disabled`.
7. **PCR0 measurement policy**: PCR0 must match the allowlist of known-good enclave
   image hashes. A PCR0 mismatch means the enclave is running different code than
   expected.

**Comparison to dstack (NearCloud/NearDirect):**

| Aspect | Dstack (TDX) | MapleAI (Nitro) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Hardware root of trust | Intel TDX via DCAP PKI | AWS Nitro via AWS PKI |
| Measurement granularity | 7 registers (MRSEAM, MRTD, RTMR0-3, MRCONFIGID) | 6+ PCRs (PCR0-4, PCR8) |
| Primary code measurement | MRTD (firmware) + RTMR1/2 (kernel/rootfs) + MRCONFIGID (compose) | PCR0 (entire EIF image hash) |
| Online collateral check | Intel PCS (TCB status, revocation) | None — no equivalent of Intel PCS for Nitro |
| Reproducible measurement derivation | `dstack-mr measure` from reproducible builds | Reproducible EIF build → PCR0 hash |

**Gap vs. dstack:** Dstack providers have an online TCB freshness check via Intel PCS
(`intel_pcs_collateral`, `tdx_tcb_current`, `tdx_tcb_not_revoked`). Nitro has no
equivalent online service for TCB validation. The AWS Nitro PKI certificate chain
provides the trust anchor, but there is no mechanism to check whether a specific
enclave image has been revoked or superseded. This means a compromised enclave image
that was once valid could continue to pass PCR0 checks until the operator manually
removes it from the allowlist.

**Gap: dstack integrity (operational, shared with dstack providers):** Like dstack
providers (see `docs/attestation_gaps/dstack_integrity.md`), MapleAI's PCR allowlist
values must be sourced out-of-band. OpenSecret publishes signed PCR0 history via
GitHub (`pcrProdHistory.json`), which is better than dstack providers (who publish
nothing), but:
- The PCR history is signed with an OpenSecret-controlled P-384 key, not by AWS
- PCR1/PCR2 values are not published
- No advance notice of PCR changes

For teep, this means PCR0 values must be maintained in the measurement policy and
updated when OpenSecret deploys new enclave images. The `tee_hardware_config` (PCR1)
and `tee_boot_config` (PCR2) factors start in `allow_fail` until values are collected.

### Chain 2: Encryption Key Binding (Attestation → E2EE Session)

**What it proves:** The session key used for E2EE was negotiated with the specific
enclave instance that produced the verified attestation document. No MITM can
substitute a different key.

**Chain of authentication:**

```
Verified COSE_Sign1 attestation document
  └─ contains (hardware-signed) → public_key: <X25519 server key, 32 bytes>
       └─ used in ECDH → shared_secret = X25519(client_private, server_public)
            └─ decrypts → encrypted_session_key (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
                 └─ yields → session_key (32 bytes)
                      └─ encrypts/decrypts → all API request/response payloads
```

**Why this chain is secure:** The server's X25519 public key is embedded in the
COSE_Sign1 payload, which is signed by the Nitro hardware PKI. A MITM attacker
cannot substitute their own public key without breaking the COSE_Sign1 signature
(which would require the AWS Nitro root private key) or the certificate chain
(which would require forging an AWS-signed certificate). Only the enclave instance
that requested the attestation document from the NSM holds the corresponding
X25519 private key (Nitro Enclaves have no persistent storage — the private key
exists only in enclave memory).

**Critical enforcement points (must never be weakened):**

1. **Attestation MUST complete before key exchange**: The public_key from the
   attestation document must be verified (full COSE_Sign1 + cert chain validation)
   BEFORE it is used for ECDH. Using an unverified public key for key exchange
   allows trivial MITM.
2. **Single key provenance path**: The server public key used for ECDH MUST be
   sourced exclusively from the verified attestation document's `public_key` field.
   Unlike TDX providers (where REPORTDATA binds a separately-obtained signing key),
   Nitro's `public_key` is inside the COSE_Sign1-signed payload — verification of
   the COSE_Sign1 signature IS the binding. The implementation must ensure a single
   code path from `NitroVerifyResult.PublicKey` → `RawAttestation.SigningKey` →
   ECDH, with no alternative key source that could be substituted. Copy the key
   bytes at extraction to prevent aliasing with mutable buffers.
3. **ECDH shared secret zeroing**: The shared secret `[]byte` MUST be zeroed
   immediately after deriving the session key via `clear(sharedSecret)`. The shared
   secret is equivalent to the session key in privilege — if leaked, all session
   traffic can be decrypted. This is achievable because the shared secret is a
   caller-owned `[]byte` returned by `ecdh.PrivateKey.ECDH()`.
4. **Client ephemeral key generation**: The X25519 client keypair MUST be generated
   fresh for each key exchange using `crypto/rand`. Reusing client keys across
   sessions would allow session key recovery if any single session is compromised.
   Note: Go's `crypto/ecdh.PrivateKey` does not expose the private scalar bytes
   for overwriting — `Bytes()` returns a copy and the internal field is unexported.
   The implementation should nil the `*ecdh.PrivateKey` reference promptly after
   use so the GC can collect it. This matches the existing `NearCloudSession.Zero()`
   pattern. See "Key Material Zeroization Constraints" below for full analysis.
5. **Session key decryption authentication**: The encrypted_session_key uses
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD). The Poly1305 tag MUST be verified — if it fails,
   the key exchange is under attack and MUST fail closed. Do not fall back to
   unauthenticated decryption.
6. **No TLS-only fallback**: If attestation or key exchange fails, the implementation
   MUST NOT fall back to sending plaintext requests over TLS. The entire security
   model depends on E2EE authenticated by attestation. TLS alone does not provide
   the enclave identity guarantee.

**Comparison to other providers:**

| Aspect | NearCloud/NearDirect (TDX) | Chutes (TDX) | MapleAI (Nitro) |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Key binding mechanism | Ed25519 signing key in TDX REPORTDATA[0:32] | SHA256(nonce+pubkey) in TDX REPORTDATA[0:32] | X25519 public_key in COSE_Sign1-signed payload |
| Key type | Ed25519 (signing) → X25519 (ECDH) | ML-KEM-768 (post-quantum KEM) | X25519 (ECDH) |
| Binding verification | Verifier checks REPORTDATA matches signing key hash | Verifier checks REPORTDATA matches SHA256(nonce+pubkey) | Verifier checks public_key field in verified attestation |
| Session key derivation | ECDH → HKDF → XChaCha20-Poly1305 | ML-KEM encapsulate → HKDF → ChaCha20-Poly1305 | ECDH → ChaCha20-Poly1305 (shared secret as direct key) |
| Channel binding | TLS SPKI pinned + E2EE | E2EE only (no TLS pinning) | E2EE only (no TLS pinning) |

**Notable difference from NearCloud/NearDirect:** Those providers use TLS SPKI pinning
as a primary channel binding mechanism — the TLS certificate fingerprint is in the
TDX REPORTDATA, and the verifier checks the live TLS connection's SPKI matches. This
provides defense-in-depth: even if E2EE were broken, the TLS channel is authenticated.
MapleAI has **no TLS channel binding** — security relies entirely on the E2EE layer
being correctly implemented and the attestation-to-key binding being maintained.
This makes the E2EE implementation a single point of failure for channel security.

**Notable difference from Chutes:** Chutes uses ML-KEM-768 (post-quantum KEM), which
is resistant to quantum computing attacks on key exchange. MapleAI uses classical
X25519, which is vulnerable to future quantum attacks on stored ciphertext
("harvest now, decrypt later"). This is a known limitation, not a blocking issue
for implementation.

### Chain 3: Enclave-to-Inference Backend (Partially Verified — Source-Auditable)

**What it proves (enclave-internal):** The sidecar proxies running inside the Nitro
Enclave verify backend attestation (Contrast/SEV-SNP for Continuum, SEV-SNP for
Tinfoil) and re-encrypt or establish attested TLS before forwarding requests. However,
this verification is not exposed to the teep client — it relies on auditing the
enclave source code and trusting the PCR0 measurement to cover it.

#### Source Code Availability

All components of the Nitro Enclave are publicly available:

| Component | Repository | Language | Role |
|-----------|-----------|----------|------|
| Enclave server | [`OpenSecretCloud/opensecret`](https://github.com/OpenSecretCloud/opensecret) | Rust | E2EE key exchange, attestation, session management, request routing |
| Continuum proxy | [`edgelesssys/privatemode-public`](https://github.com/edgelesssys/privatemode-public) (git submodule) | Go | Backend attestation (Contrast SDK) + field-level encryption for Privatemode AI |
| Tinfoil proxy | [`OpenSecretCloud/opensecret/tinfoil-proxy/`](https://github.com/OpenSecretCloud/opensecret/tree/master/tinfoil-proxy) (in-tree) | Go | Backend attestation (tinfoil-go SDK) + attestation-verified TLS |
| Nitro toolkit | [`OpenSecretCloud/nitro-toolkit`](https://github.com/OpenSecretCloud/nitro-toolkit) (git submodule) | Python | VSOCK traffic forwarding, credential requests |

The Rust server source at `src/main.rs` (~99KB) contains the `/attestation/{nonce}`
handler (NSM-signed COSE_Sign1 document with X25519 public key), the `/key_exchange`
handler (ECDH + ChaCha20-Poly1305 session establishment), and the chat completion
handler that decrypts client E2EE and forwards plaintext JSON to sidecar proxies on
localhost.

#### Enclave-Internal Data Flow

```
Client
  │ (ChaCha20-Poly1305 E2EE over HTTPS — verified by teep)
  ▼
OpenSecret Rust Server (inside Nitro Enclave)
  │ decrypt client E2EE → plaintext JSON
  │
  ├─→ http://127.0.0.1:8092 (continuum-proxy, inside enclave)
  │     │ Contrast SDK → verifies SEV-SNP attestation of Privatemode backend
  │     │ encrypts specific JSON fields (prompts/responses)
  │     │ TLS with attested mesh CA certificate
  │     ▼
  │   api.privatemode.ai (Edgeless Systems, AMD SEV-SNP GPU TEE on Scaleway)
  │     └─→ VSOCK → traffic_forwarder.py → parent EC2 instance → internet
  │
  └─→ http://127.0.0.1:8093 (tinfoil-proxy, inside enclave)
        │ tinfoil-go SDK → verifies SEV-SNP attestation via Tinfoil ATC
        │ attestation-verified TLS connection
        ▼
      inference.tinfoil.sh / router-N.tinfoil.dev (Tinfoil, AMD SEV-SNP TEE)
        └─→ VSOCK → traffic_forwarder.py → parent EC2 instance → internet
```

Plaintext inference data is exposed on localhost inside the enclave
(between the Rust server and the sidecar proxies), but **never crosses the enclave
boundary in plaintext**. The VSOCK traffic forwarders (`traffic_forwarder.py`) carry
only TLS-encrypted traffic to the parent instance.

#### How the Backend Attestation Works

**Continuum (Edgeless Privatemode AI):**
The `continuum-proxy` binary uses the Contrast SDK (`contrastsdk.NewGetter()`) to fetch
and verify a Contrast Coordinator manifest from `coordinator.privatemode.ai`. This
manifest contains reference values for the SEV-SNP attestation of the Privatemode
deployment on Scaleway. The proxy uses `GetAttestedMeshCA()` to obtain an
attestation-verified CA certificate, which is used for TLS connections to
`api.privatemode.ai`. It also performs field-level encryption of request/response
JSON using a `RenewableRequestCipher` derived from attestation secrets. It connects
to `kdsintf.amd.com` for AMD KDS (Key Distribution Service) for SEV-SNP validation,
and to `cdn.confidential.cloud` for the expected manifest hash.

**Tinfoil:**
The `tinfoil-proxy` (252 lines of Go in-tree) uses the `tinfoil-go` SDK to create an
attestation-verified HTTP client via `tinfoil.NewClient()`. This verifies SEV-SNP
attestation through Tinfoil's ATC service (`atc.tinfoil.sh`), KDS proxy
(`kds-proxy.tinfoil.sh`), and sigstore transparency logs (`tuf-repo-cdn.sigstore.dev`,
`github-proxy.tinfoil.sh`). The connection to inference endpoints uses
attestation-verified TLS.

#### Privatemode Model Weight Verification

According to the [Privatemode security documentation](https://docs.privatemode.ai/security)
and [verification from source code guide](https://docs.privatemode.ai/guides/verify-source):
- AI models are stored on **dm-verity protected disks** and mounted by disk-mounter
  containers into the Kubernetes Pods
- Container image hashes are pinned in `deployment.yaml` and enforced by the Contrast
  Coordinator
- Model root hashes can be independently reproduced via the
  [model verification guide](https://docs.privatemode.ai/guides/verify-source)

This means the **Continuum backend does provide model weight authentication** via
dm-verity, similar to Tinfoil's approach. However, this verification is performed
by the Contrast framework inside the backend infrastructure — the teep client
cannot independently verify model weights through the Nitro attestation.

#### PCR0 Coverage and Reproducible Builds

**Does PCR0 cover the re-encryption code?** Yes, indirectly:

PCR0 is the SHA-384 hash of the entire EIF (Enclave Image Format), which includes:
- The OpenSecret Rust server binary (compiled from source via `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage`)
- The `continuum-proxy` binary (Contrast attestation + re-encryption)
- The `tinfoil-proxy` binary (attestation-verified TLS proxy)
- `entrypoint.sh` (network setup, VSOCK forwarding, secret retrieval)
- Custom Linux kernel 6.12 with NSM driver
- All system libraries (glibc, openssl, python3, socat, etc.)
- NSM library (`libnsm.so`) and KMS tool (`kmstool_enclave_cli`)

The Nix build system (`flake.nix`) builds the Rust server FROM SOURCE with pinned
`Cargo.lock`. CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) runs `nix build .#eif-dev` and
`nix build .#eif-prod`, then verifies the resulting PCR values match reference files
(`pcrDev.json`, `pcrProd.json`) committed to version control. **If the source changes
and the PCR reference isn't updated, CI fails.**

**Critical provenance gap:** The `continuum-proxy` and `tinfoil-proxy` binaries are
**pre-compiled and checked into the git repo** — they are NOT built from source in
the Nix build:

```nix
# From flake.nix — copies pre-compiled binary, does NOT build from source
continuum-proxy = pkgs.runCommand "continuum-proxy" {} ''
  mkdir -p $out/bin
  cp ${./continuum-proxy} $out/bin/continuum-proxy
  chmod +x $out/bin/continuum-proxy
'';
```

The `edgelesssys/privatemode-public` README states its builds are reproducible, and
the repo is linked as a git submodule in `.gitmodules`. However:
- There is no automated CI step in the opensecret repo that builds the submodule
  from source and compares the result to the checked-in binary
- The link between a specific `privatemode-public` commit and the checked-in binary
  is trust-on-first-use
- An auditor can reproduce the binary from the submodule's pinned commit, but this
  requires manual effort

Similarly, `tinfoil-proxy/dist/tinfoil-proxy` is a pre-compiled binary, though its
Go source is in-tree at `tinfoil-proxy/main.go` (with `go.mod` and `go.sum`).

#### No Sigstore/Rekor Transparency Log Entries

No sigstore, cosign, or Rekor transparency log entries exist for:
- The `OpenSecretCloud` GitHub organization (all 6 repos)
- The `edgelesssys/privatemode-public` repository
- The EIF build artifacts or PCR history entries

The `pcrProdHistory.json` entries are signed with an OpenSecret P-384 key, but these
signatures are not published to any public transparency log. There is no independent
third-party attestation of build provenance.

Tinfoil's backend infrastructure DOES use sigstore (the tinfoil-proxy connects to
`tuf-repo-cdn.sigstore.dev` and `github-proxy.tinfoil.sh` for supply chain
verification of the Tinfoil inference nodes), but this is internal to the enclave's
verification of the Tinfoil backend — it is not exposed through the MapleAI Nitro
attestation.

#### Gap Assessment

**What IS verified (enclave-internal, auditable from source):**
1. The `continuum-proxy` verifies Contrast/SEV-SNP attestation of the Privatemode
   backend before forwarding any request
2. The `continuum-proxy` re-encrypts request fields using attestation-derived keys
3. The `tinfoil-proxy` verifies SEV-SNP attestation via Tinfoil ATC before
   establishing TLS
4. Model weights on the Privatemode backend are dm-verity protected
5. All of this code is publicly auditable

**What is NOT verifiable by the teep client:**
1. The Nitro attestation document does not include any evidence of backend attestation
2. The teep client cannot independently verify that the enclave actually performed
   backend attestation correctly — it can only verify PCR0 and trust that the
   measured code does what the source says
3. There is no GPU attestation evidence (NVIDIA EAT tokens, SPDM certs) in the
   Nitro attestation response
4. The provenance of the pre-compiled sidecar proxy binaries is not independently
   verifiable without manual reproduction

**Trust model:** The security of the enclave-to-backend link depends on:
- PCR0 measuring the correct EIF (verified by teep via Nitro attestation)
- The EIF containing the correct sidecar proxy binaries (verifiable by reproducing
  the Nix build, but not automated)
- The sidecar proxy source code implementing correct attestation verification
  (auditable, open source)
- The Contrast/Tinfoil SDKs implementing correct attestation verification
  (open source: edgelesssys/contrast, tinfoilsh/tinfoil-go)

This is a **transitive trust model**: teep verifies Nitro attestation → Nitro PCR0
measures the EIF → EIF contains sidecar proxies → sidecar proxies verify backend
attestation. The chain is auditable but not independently verifiable by the teep
client in real-time.

**Impact on teep factors:**

| Factor | Status | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `cpu_gpu_chain` | Fail (allow_fail) | Backend attestation not in Nitro attestation document |
| `measured_model_weights` | Fail (allow_fail) | dm-verity used by backend but not exposed to client |
| `nvidia_payload_present` | Skip (allow_fail) | Not applicable — backend uses AMD SEV-SNP, not NVIDIA |
| `nvidia_*` (all 5 factors) | Skip (allow_fail) | Backend is AMD SEV-SNP, not NVIDIA GPU TEE |

Note: The backend (Edgeless Privatemode AI) runs on **AMD SEV-SNP** (on Scaleway).
The entrypoint.sh connects to `kdsintf.amd.com` (AMD Key Distribution Service).
NVIDIA OCSP headers are configured in the continuum-proxy, suggesting some NVIDIA GPU
involvement, but the primary TEE platform is AMD SEV-SNP via the Contrast framework.

**Comparison to other providers:**

| Aspect | NearDirect (TDX + NVIDIA) | Chutes (TDX + NVIDIA) | MapleAI (Nitro + SEV-SNP backend) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| GPU/Backend attestation | NVIDIA EAT exposed to client | NVIDIA EAT exposed to client | SEV-SNP verified by enclave, NOT exposed to client |
| Client-verifiable backend TEE | Yes | Yes | **No** (transitive trust via PCR0) |
| Backend attestation source | teep verifies directly | teep verifies directly | Sidecar proxy verifies; auditable source code |
| Re-encryption for backend | N/A (same CVM) | E2EE via ML-KEM | Field-level encryption via Contrast + attestation-verified TLS |
| Model weight authentication | None | None | dm-verity (backend-internal, not client-exposed) |
| All code open source | Partial (NearAI proxy) | No (Chutes infrastructure) | **Yes** (opensecret, privatemode-public, tinfoil-proxy) |

**What would make the gap fully closeable from teep's perspective:**
1. Include the Contrast manifest hash or the backend's SEV-SNP attestation report
   hash in the Nitro attestation document's `user_data` field — this would let
   clients verify the backend's identity through the Nitro attestation chain
2. Expose the backend attestation evidence as a separate endpoint that teep can
   fetch and verify independently
3. Build the sidecar proxies from source in the Nix build, eliminating the
   pre-compiled binary provenance gap

Until one of these is implemented, teep must treat backend attestation as a known
gap in the allow_fail list. The enclave does verify the backend, and the verification
code is fully auditable — but this verification is not independently confirmable by
the teep client through the Nitro attestation alone.

### Chain 4: Request Integrity (Session → Per-Request Encryption)

**What it proves:** Each request and response is encrypted with the session key that
was derived from the attestation-authenticated key exchange. Tampering with any
request or response is detected by the Poly1305 authentication tag.

**Chain of authentication:**

```
session_key (from Chain 2)
  └─ ChaCha20-Poly1305 Seal(random_nonce, plaintext_request) → encrypted_request
       └─ sent as {"encrypted": "<base64>"} with x-session-id header
            └─ server decrypts with same session_key
                 └─ processes request (inside enclave boundary only)
                      └─ ChaCha20-Poly1305 Seal(random_nonce, plaintext_response)
                           └─ client decrypts with session_key
```

**Critical enforcement points:**

1. **Random nonce per encryption**: Each ChaCha20-Poly1305 operation MUST use a fresh
   12-byte random nonce from `crypto/rand`. Nonce reuse with the same key is
   catastrophic — it allows plaintext recovery. The implementation MUST NOT use
   a counter-based nonce (risk of collision across concurrent requests sharing a
   session).
2. **Authentication tag verification**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 `Open()` verifies the
   Poly1305 tag. On tag mismatch, the implementation MUST return
   `ErrDecryptionFailed` and MUST NOT return partial plaintext. Tag failure indicates
   either corruption or active MITM.
3. **No plaintext fallback**: If decryption fails, the implementation MUST NOT attempt
   to parse the response as unencrypted JSON. This would silently bypass E2EE if the
   server returned plaintext (e.g., due to a server bug or downgrade attack).
4. **Bounded reads**: Encrypted response bodies must be bounded (e.g., 10 MiB, in
   line with existing relay limits in `internal/e2ee/relay.go`) to prevent memory
   exhaustion from a malicious server sending unbounded ciphertext.
5. **SSE `[DONE]` handling**: The `data: [DONE]` sentinel is NOT encrypted. The
   implementation must handle this correctly: do NOT attempt to base64-decode or
   decrypt `[DONE]`. But also do NOT accept any other unencrypted data lines as
   valid response content — non-decodeable lines should be skipped silently (they
   may be heartbeats), but they must never be forwarded as API response data.

### Summary: What MapleAI Attestation Does and Does Not Prove

| Claim | Proven? | Mechanism | Comparable to |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Client is talking to a genuine AWS Nitro Enclave | **Yes** | COSE_Sign1 chain to AWS root cert | TDX quote chain to Intel DCAP PKI |
| Enclave is running expected proxy code | **Yes** | PCR0 matches measurement allowlist | MRTD + compose binding in dstack |

### Implementation Implications

The authentication chain analysis has these specific implications for the implementation:

1. **The `tee_reportdata_binding` factor for Nitro** should verify that
   `NitroVerifyResult.PublicKey` is non-nil, exactly 32 bytes, and matches the server
   X25519 public key actually used for the ECDH key exchange in `MapleAISession`.
   The attestation-side authentication is via the COSE_Sign1 signature (the
   `public_key` is in the signed payload), NOT via a separate REPORTDATA field like
   TDX; the factor is only complete once the verified attested `public_key` is
   compared to the runtime ECDH peer key. The factor should Pass with detail like
   "Attested X25519 public key authenticated by COSE_Sign1 and matched to ECDH peer
   key" to distinguish it from both TDX REPORTDATA binding and the weaker structural
   `signing_key_present` check.

2. **The `signing_key_present` factor** should check
   `NitroVerifyResult.PublicKey != nil && len(NitroVerifyResult.PublicKey) == 32`.
   For Nitro, the "signing key" is the X25519 public key (used for ECDH, not signing),
   so the factor detail should say "X25519 public key (32 bytes) present in attestation"
   to avoid confusion with dstack providers where it's an Ed25519 or secp256k1 signing
   key. This factor is intentionally structural only; it does not by itself prove that
   the attested key was the one used during session establishment.

3. **The E2EE session (`MapleAISession`) MUST store the attested server public key**
   and the exact server public key observed during ECDH session establishment, then
   compare them via `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` before marking the session usable.
   A mismatch MUST fail closed and abort the request. This comparison is
   defense-in-depth: even though both values originate from the same
   `RawAttestation.SigningKey`, recording and comparing them independently guards
   against code-path bugs that could cause a different key to be used for ECDH than
   the one authenticated by attestation. The session cache MUST be keyed by the
   hex-encoded verified attested server public key. If a new attestation returns a
   different server public key (enclave restarted), existing cached sessions for the
   old key MUST be invalidated.

4. **Session invalidation on attestation cache miss**: When the attestation cache
   expires (1h TTL) or is manually invalidated, all E2EE sessions derived from that
   attestation's public key MUST also be invalidated. Stale sessions with a
   potentially-rotated enclave key are a security risk.

5. **The report MUST clearly communicate the backend attestation model.** The
   `cpu_gpu_chain` and `measured_model_weights` factors will Fail (allowed), but the
   report detail strings should communicate that backend attestation IS performed by
   the enclave's sidecar proxies but is not client-verifiable through the Nitro
   attestation. Suggested details:
   - `cpu_gpu_chain`: "backend SEV-SNP attestation verified by enclave sidecar proxy (Contrast SDK); not independently verifiable by client through Nitro attestation"
   - `measured_model_weights`: "backend uses dm-verity protected model weights (Privatemode); not client-verifiable through Nitro attestation"

6. **Factor enforcement parity with dstack providers**: Despite the GPU gap, the
   Nitro-verifiable factors (enclave identity, key binding, E2EE) provide equivalent
   or stronger assurance than the corresponding dstack factors. The implementation
   should enforce these strictly — they are the only authentication chain available.

## Protocol Specifications

All protocols below are described from publicly documented standards and the public
OpenSecret SDK documentation (https://docs.opensecret.cloud/). No proprietary source
code is referenced.

### 1. AWS Nitro Attestation Document Format

**Reference:** [AWS Nitro Enclaves — Verifying the Root of Trust](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/verify-root.html)

The attestation document is a **COSE_Sign1** structure (RFC 9052 §4.2), encoded in
**CBOR** (RFC 8949), structured as a 4-element CBOR array:

| Index | Name        | Type  | Content                                          |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | protected   | bstr  | CBOR-encoded protected headers map `{1: -35}` (algorithm: ECDSA-384) |
| 1     | unprotected | map   | Empty map `{}`                                   |
| 2     | payload     | bstr  | CBOR-encoded attestation document (see below)    |
| 3     | signature   | bstr  | ECDSA P-384 raw signature (r‖s, 96 bytes)        |

The tagged COSE_Sign1 structure uses CBOR tag 18.

**Attestation payload** (CBOR map, per AWS documentation):

| Field        | CBOR Type          | Description                                    |
|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `module_id`  | text string        | Enclave module identifier                      |
| `timestamp`  | uint (.size 8)     | UTC milliseconds since UNIX epoch              |
| `digest`     | text string        | Always `"SHA384"`                              |
| `pcrs`       | map<uint → bstr>   | Platform Configuration Registers (48 bytes each, SHA-384) |
| `certificate`| bstr               | DER-encoded leaf X.509 certificate             |
| `cabundle`   | array<bstr>        | DER-encoded certificate chain (root first)     |
| `public_key` | bstr or nil        | Server's **X25519 public key** (32 bytes) for E2EE |
| `user_data`  | bstr or nil        | Application-specific data                      |
| `nonce`      | bstr or nil        | Client nonce (UTF-8 encoded string as bytes)   |

### 2. COSE_Sign1 Signature Verification

**Reference:** RFC 9052 §4.4 — Signing and Verification Process

1. CBOR-decode the outer 4-element array
2. Extract `protected` (index 0), `payload` (index 2), `signature` (index 3)
3. Construct `Sig_structure`: CBOR array `["Signature1", protected, b"", payload]`
4. CBOR-encode the `Sig_structure` → this is the signed message
5. Parse the leaf certificate (from payload's `certificate` field) as X.509 DER
6. Extract the P-384 public key from the leaf certificate
7. Verify the ECDSA-P384-SHA384 signature over the `Sig_structure` bytes
8. **Signature format**: Raw r‖s (96 bytes total: 48 bytes r + 48 bytes s), NOT ASN.1
   DER. Must convert to ASN.1 for Go's `ecdsa.VerifyASN1`, or use
   `crypto/ecdsa.Verify` with `r, s *big.Int` parsed from the raw bytes.

### 3. Certificate Chain Validation

**Reference:** [AWS Nitro Enclaves Root of Trust](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/verify-root.html)

The AWS Nitro root certificate is available from:
`https://aws-nitro-enclaves.amazonaws.com/AWS_NitroEnclaves_Root-G1.zip`

Root certificate fingerprint (SHA-256):
```
64:1A:03:21:A3:E2:44:EF:E4:56:46:31:95:D6:06:31:7E:D7:CD:CC:3C:17:56:E0:98:93:F3:C6:8F:79:BB:5B
```

Root certificate subject: `CN=aws.nitro-enclaves, C=US, O=Amazon, OU=AWS`
Root certificate lifetime: 30 years. Algorithm: ECDSA P-384.

**Validation steps:**

1. `cabundle` is ordered `[ROOT_CERT, INTERM_1, INTERM_2, ..., INTERM_N]` (root first)
2. `cabundle[0]` must be **byte-identical** to the embedded AWS Nitro root cert DER
3. Each certificate in `cabundle` parsed as X.509 DER; check time validity
   (`NotBefore ≤ now ≤ NotAfter`)
4. Chain validation: root → intermediate(s). Each cert's signature verified against
   parent cert's public key
5. The leaf `certificate` from the payload: its issuer must match the last cabundle
   cert's subject, and its signature must verify against that cert's public key
6. Leaf cert time validity check
7. **Algorithms**: ECDSA P-384/SHA-384 (OID `1.2.840.10045.4.3.3`) primary, with
   fallback to P-256/SHA-256 (OID `1.2.840.10045.4.3.2`)

### 4. PCR Validation

**Reference:** [AWS Nitro Enclaves Attestation Process](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api/blob/main/docs/attestation_process.md), [OpenSecret Remote Attestation Guide](https://docs.opensecret.cloud/docs/guides/remote-attestation/)

AWS Nitro PCR semantics:

| PCR | Size     | Description                                          |
|-----|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 0   | 48 bytes | Enclave image file hash (primary measurement)        |
| 1   | 48 bytes | Linux kernel and bootstrap hash                      |
| 2   | 48 bytes | Application code hash                                |
| 3   | 48 bytes | IAM role assigned to parent instance (not for attestation) |
| 4   | 48 bytes | Instance ID of parent instance (changes per instance) |
| 8   | 48 bytes | Enclave image signing certificate hash               |

**Debug mode detection**: When an enclave runs in debug mode, **PCR0 is all zeros**
(48 zero bytes). This must be detected and cause `tee_debug_disabled` to FAIL.

**PCR0 is the primary measurement** for MapleAI. The default measurement policy should
contain known-good PCR0 values. These can be obtained by:
1. Fetching a live attestation document from the production endpoint
2. Consulting OpenSecret's published PCR history at:
   - Production: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSecretCloud/opensecret/master/pcrProdHistory.json`
   - Development: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSecretCloud/opensecret/master/pcrDevHistory.json`

PCR1/PCR2 should be validated when known-good values are available, but may be in
`allow_fail` initially.

### 5. Attestation Fetch Endpoint

```
GET /attestation/{nonce}
Host: enclave.trymaple.ai
```

- `{nonce}`: Client-generated UUID v4 string (e.g., `"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`)
- Response: `{"attestation_document": "<base64-encoded COSE_Sign1 binary>"}`
- Content-Type: `application/json`

**Nonce verification**: After parsing the attestation payload, the `nonce` field
(UTF-8 decoded) must match the client-generated UUID v4 nonce. Mismatch → FAIL CLOSED.

**NOTE on nonce format and `nonce_match` factor**: teep's existing providers use a
32-byte hex nonce (`attestation.Nonce`). MapleAI uses a UUID v4 string nonce instead.
These are incompatible formats — the existing `evalNonceMatch` compares
`in.Raw.Nonce` against `in.Nonce.Hex()` (64 hex chars), which would always fail for
a UUID string.

The MapleAI attester must:
1. Accept the standard `nonce attestation.Nonce` argument from the proxy (preserving
   the existing `Attester.FetchAttestation` interface unchanged)
2. Generate a separate UUID v4 as the Nitro-specific challenge nonce
3. Store the UUID v4 in a new `NitroNonce string` field on `RawAttestation`
4. Store the original `attestation.Nonce` in `RawAttestation.Nonce` as hex (unchanged)

The `nonce_match` evaluator must be extended with a Nitro path:
- For Nitro attestations (`in.Raw.BackendFormat == FormatNitro`): compare
  `in.Raw.NitroNonce` against the nonce extracted from the verified Nitro attestation
  document's payload using `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`. This verifies the UUID v4
  round-trip (client generated it, enclave echoed it in the hardware-signed document).
- The canonical `in.Nonce` (`attestation.Nonce`) remains available for cache keying
  and report inputs but is NOT sent to the MapleAI endpoint.

This avoids overloading the `Nonce` field with a different format and keeps the
existing nonce pipeline intact for all other providers.

### 6. Key Exchange Protocol

After successful attestation verification:

```
POST /key_exchange
Host: enclave.trymaple.ai
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client_public_key": "<base64 of 32-byte X25519 public key>",
  "nonce": "<same UUID nonce used for attestation>"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "encrypted_session_key": "<base64 of nonce(12) || ciphertext>",
  "session_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

**Key exchange steps** (all using Go stdlib + `golang.org/x/crypto`):

1. Generate ephemeral X25519 keypair (RFC 7748): `curve25519.ScalarBaseMult` or
   `ecdh.X25519().GenerateKey(crypto/rand)`
2. Extract server's X25519 public key from `raw.SigningKey` (populated from the
   verified attestation document's `public_key` field during `FetchAttestation`)
3. Use this key directly for ECDH — it is the sole source, already authenticated
   by COSE_Sign1 verification. No separate comparison is needed (see Chain 2,
   point 2: "Single key provenance path").
4. Compute shared secret: `X25519(client_private_key, server_public_key)` → 32 bytes
5. Base64-decode `encrypted_session_key`
6. Split: first 12 bytes = nonce, remainder = ciphertext
7. Decrypt with **ChaCha20-Poly1305** (RFC 8439) using the shared secret as the
   symmetric key
8. Decrypted result: 32-byte session key
9. Store `(session_id, session_key)` for subsequent API calls
10. **Clear the shared secret `[]byte` via `clear(sharedSecret)`, then nil the
    ephemeral `*ecdh.PrivateKey` reference.** Go's `crypto/ecdh.PrivateKey` does
    not expose the private scalar for in-place overwriting (see "Key Material
    Zeroization Constraints" below). Nil-ing the reference allows GC collection.
    This matches the existing `NearCloudSession.Zero()` and `ChutesSession.Zero()`
    patterns.

#### Key Material Zeroization Constraints

Go's `crypto/ecdh.PrivateKey` stores the private scalar in an unexported `privateKey
[]byte` field. The `Bytes()` method returns a copy — overwriting it has no effect on
the internal state. There is no `Clear()` or `Zero()` method on the type.

This is a known limitation shared by all teep E2EE providers that use `crypto/ecdh`:

| Provider | Key type | Zero() behavior | Source |
|----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| NearCloud | `*ecdh.PrivateKey` (X25519) | Nils reference; internal scalar persists until GC | `e2ee/nearcloud.go:94` |
| Chutes | `*mlkem.DecapsulationKey` | Nils reference; internal key persists until GC | `e2ee/chutes.go:70` |
| Venice | `*secp256k1.PrivateKey` (dcrd) | Calls `privateKey.Zero()` (dcrd exposes this) | `e2ee/venice.go:88` |
| **MapleAI** | `*ecdh.PrivateKey` (X25519) | Nil reference (same as NearCloud) | (this plan) |

**What CAN be zeroed (caller-owned `[]byte` slices):**
- ECDH shared secret returned by `PrivateKey.ECDH()` — `clear(sharedSecret)` once key derivation completes
- Any intermediate HKDF output bytes — `clear(...)` once they are no longer needed
- Derived session key bytes — only `clear(sessionKey)` immediately after constructing the AEAD cipher if the implementation stores the initialized AEAD and does **not** retain `sessionKey []byte`; if `MapleAISession` keeps `sessionKey []byte` for ongoing request encryption/decryption, defer zeroization until session teardown

**What CANNOT be zeroed through public API:**
- `crypto/ecdh.PrivateKey` internal scalar (unexported field, `Bytes()` returns copy)
- `crypto/mlkem.DecapsulationKey` internal state (same limitation)
- `cipher.AEAD` internal key copy (chacha20poly1305 stores a copy internally)

**Why we do not use alternative approaches:**

1. **`unsafe.Pointer` to reach unexported fields:** Fragile, breaks across Go
   versions and with BoringCrypto/FIPS mode. This is rolling our own crypto cleanup
   code and would be a maintenance burden with no guarantee of correctness.
2. **`golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519` with raw `[32]byte` scalar:** This package
   now wraps `crypto/ecdh` internally — `NewPrivateKey` clones the input. Using
   the raw API would bypass the standard library's validation and is not recommended.
3. **`runtime/secret` (experimental, Go 1.24+):** The Go team's official solution,
   but requires `GOEXPERIMENT=runtimesecret`, is linux-only (amd64/arm64), and is
   not subject to the Go 1 compatibility promise. It is not appropriate for
   production use at this time.

**Accepted tradeoff:** The ephemeral `crypto/ecdh.PrivateKey` scalar persists in
memory from key generation until GC collection. This is mitigated by:
- The key is ephemeral (fresh per key exchange, not long-lived)
- The reference is nil-ed promptly, making it eligible for GC
- teep runs inside a process that handles only proxy traffic (limited attack surface
  for memory disclosure)
- The same limitation exists in WireGuard-go, age (filippo.io/age), and all other Go
  programs using `crypto/ecdh`
- All caller-owned intermediate secrets (shared secret, derived keys) ARE zeroed

This is consistent with the WireGuard-go project's documented position: "Due to
limitations in Go and /x/crypto there is currently no way to ensure that key
material is securely erased in memory."

### 7. Encrypted API Request Format

All API requests after key exchange use the session:

```
POST /v1/chat/completions
Host: enclave.trymaple.ai
Content-Type: application/json
x-session-id: <session_id UUID>
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>

{"encrypted": "<base64 of nonce(12) || ciphertext>"}
```

**Encryption steps:**
1. JSON-serialize the OpenAI-compatible request body
2. Generate random 12-byte nonce via `crypto/rand`
3. Encrypt with ChaCha20-Poly1305 using `session_key` → ciphertext (includes 16-byte
   Poly1305 tag)
4. Concatenate: `nonce(12) || ciphertext`
5. Base64-encode
6. Wrap in JSON: `{"encrypted": "<base64>"}`

### 8. Encrypted Response Format (Non-Streaming)

```json
{"encrypted": "<base64 of nonce(12) || ciphertext>"}
```

**Decryption steps:**
1. Parse JSON, extract `encrypted` field
2. Base64-decode → binary blob
3. Split: first 12 bytes = nonce, remainder = ciphertext
4. ChaCha20-Poly1305 decrypt with `session_key`
5. Parse decrypted bytes as OpenAI-compatible JSON response

### 9. Encrypted SSE Streaming Format

For `stream: true` requests:

1. Request encrypted identically to non-streaming
2. Response is an SSE event stream (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`)
3. Each `data:` line contains a **base64-encoded encrypted chunk** (raw base64 string,
   NOT wrapped in JSON)
4. Per-chunk decryption:
   - Base64-decode the `data:` line value
   - Split: first 12 bytes = nonce, remainder = ciphertext
   - ChaCha20-Poly1305 decrypt with `session_key`
   - Parse decrypted bytes as `ChatCompletionChunk` JSON
5. `data: [DONE]` signals end of stream (not encrypted, pass through)
6. Non-base64 data lines (heartbeats, empty lines) are silently skipped

**This is whole-body encryption** (entire chunk encrypted), unlike NearCloud/Venice
(per-field encryption within JSON). This requires a dedicated SSE relay function
similar to `relay_chutes.go`, NOT the generic per-field `RelayStream` from `relay.go`.

### 10. Available API Endpoints

| Method | Path                    | Purpose                            | Encrypted |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| GET    | /health                 | Health check                       | No        |
| GET    | /v1/models              | List models (OpenAI-compatible)    | No        |
| GET    | /attestation/{nonce}    | Fetch attestation document         | No        |
| POST   | /key_exchange           | Establish E2EE session             | No (but uses ECDH) |
| POST   | /v1/chat/completions    | Chat completions                   | Yes       |
| POST   | /v1/embeddings          | Create embeddings                  | Yes       |

### 11. Session Retry Protocol

MapleAI session retry handling requires explicit provider-specific logic in the proxy
relay path. The current relay behavior forwards upstream non-200 responses directly for
non-Chutes providers, so this plan must not treat every upstream HTTP 400 as a generic
session failure signal.

For MapleAI, retry behavior should apply only when the upstream response is identified
as a MapleAI session/decryption failure (e.g., a documented stale-session or
ChaCha20-Poly1305 authentication failure error body), not to arbitrary HTTP 400
responses.

Required MapleAI-specific proxy behavior:
1. Detect MapleAI session/decryption failure responses in the relay loop (match on
   specific error body content, not just HTTP status code)
2. Invalidate the cached session for this model
3. Invalidate the cached attestation report for this model
4. Re-perform full attestation handshake (attestation fetch → verify → key exchange)
5. Retry the original request once with the new session
6. If retry also fails, return error to client (do NOT retry indefinitely)

Until this provider-specific handling is implemented, generic upstream HTTP 400 and
other non-200 responses from MapleAI should be forwarded as upstream errors rather than
triggering session+attestation invalidation implicitly.

## Attestation Factor Design

### Factor Rename: `tdx_*` → `tee_*`

This plan uses generalized `tee_*` factor names throughout. The tinfoil support plan
(`docs/plans/tinfoil_support.md`) proposes an atomic rename of existing `tdx_*` factors
to `tee_*` to support multiple TEE hardware platforms (Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, AWS
Nitro). The rename mapping:

| Current (TDX-specific)    | Generalized            | Applies To             |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| `tdx_quote_present`       | `tee_quote_present`    | TDX, SEV-SNP, Nitro   |
| `tdx_quote_structure`     | `tee_quote_structure`  | TDX, SEV-SNP, Nitro   |
| `tdx_cert_chain`          | `tee_cert_chain`       | TDX, Nitro             |
| `tdx_quote_signature`     | `tee_quote_signature`  | TDX, SEV-SNP, Nitro   |
| `tdx_debug_disabled`      | `tee_debug_disabled`   | TDX, Nitro             |
| `tdx_mrseam_mrtd`         | `tee_measurement`      | TDX (MRTD/MRSEAM), Nitro (PCR0) |
| `tdx_hardware_config`     | `tee_hardware_config`  | TDX (RTMR0), Nitro (PCR1) |
| `tdx_boot_config`         | `tee_boot_config`      | TDX (RTMR1/2), Nitro (PCR2) |
| `tdx_reportdata_binding`  | `tee_reportdata_binding` | TDX, Nitro (public_key binding) |
| `intel_pcs_collateral`    | `intel_pcs_collateral` | TDX only (unchanged)   |
| `tdx_tcb_current`         | `tdx_tcb_current`      | TDX only (unchanged)   |
| `tdx_tcb_not_revoked`     | `tdx_tcb_not_revoked`  | TDX only (unchanged)   |

**Implementation note**: If the `tee_*` rename has not yet been performed when MapleAI
implementation begins, the implementer should either (a) perform the rename as Phase 1
of this plan, or (b) use `nitro_*` prefixed names initially and participate in the
rename later. Option (a) is preferred for consistency.

### MapleAI Enforced Factor Set

**Enforced factors** (must pass or request is blocked):

| Factor                   | What It Verifies (Nitro)                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `nonce_match`            | Client UUID nonce matches attestation doc nonce    |
| `tee_quote_present`      | COSE_Sign1 attestation document received           |
| `tee_quote_structure`    | Valid CBOR structure, all required payload fields  |
| `tee_cert_chain`         | Certificate chain validates to AWS Nitro root      |
| `tee_quote_signature`    | COSE_Sign1 ECDSA-P384 signature verifies           |
| `tee_debug_disabled`     | PCR0 is NOT all-zeros (not debug mode)             |
| `tee_measurement`        | PCR0 matches measurement allowlist                 |
| `signing_key_present`    | X25519 `public_key` present in attestation doc     |
| `tee_reportdata_binding` | Attested public_key matches key exchange public_key |
| `e2ee_capable`           | E2EE material (session key) successfully derived   |
| `e2ee_usable`            | Successful E2EE round-trip (post-relay check)      |

**MapleAI DefaultAllowFail** (factors that Skip or are allowed to fail):

```go
var MapleAIDefaultAllowFail = []string{
    "tee_hardware_config",      // PCR1 — kernel hash, TBD
    "tee_boot_config",          // PCR2 — app hash, TBD
    "intel_pcs_collateral",     // Intel-only, N/A
    "tdx_tcb_current",          // Intel-only, N/A
    "tdx_tcb_not_revoked",      // Intel-only, N/A
    "nvidia_payload_present",   // No GPU attestation exposed
    "nvidia_signature",         // No GPU attestation exposed
    "nvidia_claims",            // No GPU attestation exposed
    "nvidia_nonce_client_bound",// No GPU attestation exposed

    "build_transparency_log",   // No Rekor
    "cpu_id_registry",          // No Proof of Cloud
    "compose_binding",          // No Docker compose
    "sigstore_verification",    // No Sigstore
    "event_log_integrity",      // No event log
    // All gateway_* factors — no gateway architecture
}
```

### NitroVerifyResult Type

New type in `internal/attestation/`:

```go
type NitroVerifyResult struct {
    Parsed          bool       // COSE_Sign1 + CBOR successfully decoded
    CertChainValid  bool       // Certificate chain validates to AWS root
    SignatureValid  bool       // COSE_Sign1 signature verifies
    DebugMode       bool       // PCR0 is all-zeros
    NonceMatch      bool       // Attestation nonce matches client nonce
    PCRs            map[uint][]byte // All PCR values (48 bytes each)
    PublicKey       []byte     // X25519 public key (32 bytes) from attestation
    ModuleID        string     // Enclave module identifier
    Timestamp       int64      // Attestation timestamp (Unix ms)
    CertChainDetail string     // Human-readable cert chain status
    SignatureDetail string     // Human-readable signature status
    ParseDetail     string     // Human-readable parse status
    Error           error      // First fatal error encountered
}
```

New field in `ReportInput`: `Nitro *NitroVerifyResult`

### Evaluator Generalization

Existing TDX evaluator functions (after rename to `tee_*`) must become TEE-generic,
checking whichever hardware result is present. Pattern:

```
evalTEEQuotePresent:
  if in.TDX != nil → check TDX quote present
  else if in.Nitro != nil → check Nitro doc present
  else → Skip("no TEE attestation available")

evalTEEQuoteStructure:
  if in.TDX != nil → check TDX parsed
  else if in.Nitro != nil → check Nitro parsed
  (similar pattern for cert_chain, signature, debug_disabled, etc.)

evalTEEMrseamMrtd:
  if in.TDX != nil → check MRTD/MRSEAM against policy
  else if in.Nitro != nil → check PCR0 against policy.PCR0Allow
```

The `MeasurementPolicy` struct needs a new field: `PCR0Allow []string` (hex-encoded
48-byte SHA-384 hashes). Existing MRTD/MRSEAM fields remain for TDX.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Nitro Attestation Core (`internal/attestation/nitro.go`)

**New dependency**: `fxamacker/cbor/v2` (add to go.mod)

**New files:**
- `internal/attestation/nitro.go` — Nitro COSE_Sign1 parsing and verification
- `internal/attestation/nitro_test.go` — Unit tests
- `internal/attestation/certs/aws_nitro_root.der` — Embedded AWS root certificate

**Functions to implement:**

1. `ParseNitroDocument(docBase64 string) (*NitroDocument, error)` — Base64-decode →
   CBOR-decode COSE_Sign1 → extract all fields
2. `VerifyNitroCertChain(doc *NitroDocument, now time.Time) error` — Validate chain
   from cabundle[0] (must match embedded root) through intermediates to leaf cert
3. `VerifyNitroSignature(doc *NitroDocument) error` — Construct Sig_structure, verify
   ECDSA-P384-SHA384 with leaf cert's public key
4. `VerifyNitroDocument(docBase64, clientNonce string) (*NitroVerifyResult, error)` —
   Orchestrator: parse → verify chain → verify signature → check nonce → check
   debug mode → extract public_key → return result
5. `IsNitroDebugMode(pcrs map[uint][]byte) bool` — Check PCR0 all-zeros
6. `NitroPCRMatchesPolicy(pcrs map[uint][]byte, policy *MeasurementPolicy) (bool, string)` —
   Check PCR0/1/2/8 against allowlists

**Internal types:**
```go
type NitroDocument struct {
    Protected   []byte          // Raw protected headers
    Payload     []byte          // Raw payload bytes (for Sig_structure)
    Signature   []byte          // Raw signature (96 bytes)
    ModuleID    string
    Timestamp   uint64
    Digest      string
    PCRs        map[uint][]byte
    Certificate []byte          // DER leaf cert
    CABundle    [][]byte        // DER cert chain
    PublicKey   []byte          // X25519 (32 bytes) or nil
    UserData    []byte          // or nil
    Nonce       []byte          // UTF-8 encoded nonce or nil
}
```

**AWS root certificate embedding:**
- Download from `https://aws-nitro-enclaves.amazonaws.com/AWS_NitroEnclaves_Root-G1.zip`
- Extract DER file, embed via `//go:embed certs/aws_nitro_root.der`
- Verify the embedded DER's SHA-256 fingerprint against the published AWS value via a
  unit test over the embedded bytes (not at runtime in the hot path). The fingerprint
  check is an asset-integrity guard, ensuring the checked-in file hasn't been
  corrupted or substituted. Do not hash the embedded root during request handling.
- Reject chains where `cabundle[0]` is not byte-identical to embedded root

**Test plan:**
- Embedded root integrity test: hash the `//go:embed` bytes of
  `certs/aws_nitro_root.der` with `sha256.Sum256` and compare against the expected
  published fingerprint. This is a unit test, not a build-time assertion or runtime
  check.
- Parsing round-trip: construct a synthetic/self-signed COSE_Sign1 test document with
  known values and verify parsing extracts all fields correctly. This covers parsing
  and field handling only, not a successful `VerifyNitroCertChain` path.
- Positive cert-chain + signature verification: check in a captured real AWS Nitro
  attestation fixture under `testdata/` whose `cabundle[0]` matches the embedded AWS
  root by byte identity. Use this fixture to exercise `VerifyNitroCertChain` success
  and full COSE signature verification success without weakening root pinning.
- Invalid signature: tamper with the payload or signature bytes of the real fixture
  after capture, verify signature check fails.
- Invalid cert chain: use a synthetic/self-signed chain or mutate the fixture
  `cabundle` so `cabundle[0]` is not the embedded AWS root, verify chain validation
  fails closed.
- Expired certificate: drive verification with a time after `NotAfter` against a real
  Nitro fixture chain. Do not relax the root pin for this test.
- Do **not** add a test-only bypass or alternate root for `VerifyNitroCertChain`;
  tests must preserve the same pinned-root requirement as production.
- Missing nonce: verify nonce check fails when nonce field is nil
- Wrong nonce: verify nonce mismatch is detected
- Debug mode: PCR0 all-zeros → `IsNitroDebugMode` returns true
- Missing public_key: verify detection
- Malformed CBOR: truncated, wrong types, extra fields
- Fuzz tests: `fuzz_test.go` with `ParseNitroDocument` on random base64 inputs
- **Bound reads**: CBOR arrays/maps must be bounded (reject docs with >64 PCRs,
  >32 cabundle certs, fields >1 MiB)

**Reference patterns:**
- `internal/attestation/tdx.go` for TDX quote parsing structure
- `internal/attestation/nvidia_eat.go` for external token parsing + verification
- Use `internal/jsonstrict` for any JSON parsing (attestation fetch response)

### Phase 2: Attestation Report Integration

**Depends on**: Phase 1

**Modified files:**
- `internal/attestation/report.go` — Add `NitroVerifyResult`, `Nitro` field in
  `ReportInput`, update evaluator functions, add `MapleAIDefaultAllowFail`
- `internal/attestation/report_test.go` — Tests for Nitro factors
- `internal/attestation/attestation.go` — Add `FormatNitro` to `BackendFormat`,
  add Nitro-related fields to `RawAttestation`
- `internal/attestation/measurement_policy.go` — Add `PCR0Allow`, `PCR1Allow`,
  `PCR2Allow`, `PCR8Allow` fields to `MeasurementPolicy`
- `internal/attestation/export_test.go` — Export new test helpers

**Factor implementation approach (two options):**

*If `tee_*` rename is done first:* Update existing `eval*` functions to check for
Nitro results alongside TDX results. Each evaluator becomes a dispatcher:
`in.TDX` present → existing TDX logic; `in.Nitro` present → new Nitro logic.

*If `tee_*` rename is deferred:* Add parallel `nitro_*` factors and evaluators.
Add them to `KnownFactors`. The rename folds them into `tee_*` later.

**Test plan:**
- `TestBuildReportNitroFactorCount` — Assert correct factor count with Nitro input
- `TestBuildReportNitroEnforcedFlags` — Verify enforcement for MapleAI allow-fail
- `TestBuildReportNitroBlocked` — Verify `Blocked()` when Nitro signature fails
- `TestBuildReportNitroPass` — Verify all Nitro factors pass with valid input
- `TestBuildReportNitroDebugMode` — Verify `tee_debug_disabled` fails
- `TestBuildReportNitroPCRMismatch` — Verify `tee_measurement` fails
- `TestBuildReportMixedTDXNitro` — Verify only one TEE type evaluated (mutual exclusion)
- Counter consistency: `Passed + Failed + Skipped == len(Factors)`

### Phase 3: MapleAI E2EE Session (`internal/e2ee/mapleai.go`)

**Depends on**: None (can parallel with Phases 1-2)

**New files:**
- `internal/e2ee/mapleai.go` — `MapleAISession` E2EE implementation
- `internal/e2ee/mapleai_test.go` — Unit tests
- `internal/e2ee/relay_mapleai.go` — SSE relay for MapleAI encrypted streams
- `internal/e2ee/relay_mapleai_test.go` — Relay tests

**`MapleAISession` struct:**
```go
type MapleAISession struct {
    clientPrivate  *ecdh.PrivateKey  // X25519 ephemeral private key
    clientPublic   []byte            // 32 bytes
    serverPublic   []byte            // 32 bytes (from attestation)
    sessionKey     []byte            // 32 bytes (from key exchange)
    sessionID      string            // UUID from server
}
```

**Methods:**
- `NewMapleAISession() (*MapleAISession, error)` — Generate X25519 keypair via
  `ecdh.X25519().GenerateKey(crypto/rand)`. Fail if RNG fails.
- `SetServerPublicKey(pubKey []byte) error` — Store the attested server public key.
  Validate length == 32 bytes.
- `ClientPublicKeyBase64() string` — Base64-encode client public key for key exchange
- `EstablishSession(encryptedSessionKey []byte, sessionID string) error`:
  1. Compute shared secret: `clientPrivate.ECDH(serverPublicKey)`
  2. Split `encryptedSessionKey`: nonce(12) || ciphertext
  3. ChaCha20-Poly1305 Open with shared secret as key, nonce, ciphertext
  4. Validate decrypted key is 32 bytes
  5. Store `sessionKey` and `sessionID`
  6. **Zero shared secret immediately after deriving session key**
- `EncryptRequest(plaintext []byte) ([]byte, error)`:
  1. Generate 12-byte random nonce
  2. ChaCha20-Poly1305 Seal with sessionKey
  3. Return `nonce || ciphertext`
- `DecryptResponse(encrypted []byte) ([]byte, error)`:
  1. Validate length ≥ 12 + 16 (nonce + min ciphertext with tag)
  2. Split nonce(12), ciphertext
  3. ChaCha20-Poly1305 Open with sessionKey
  4. Return plaintext
- `SessionID() string` — Return session_id for header injection
- `IsEncryptedChunk(val string) bool` — Check if value is base64 and decodes to ≥28
  bytes (12 nonce + 16 tag minimum)
- `Decrypt(ciphertext string) ([]byte, error)` — Base64-decode → `DecryptResponse`
- `Zero()` — Zero sessionKey bytes, nil all key references

**Implements `Decryptor` interface** (for type assertion in proxy relay dispatch).

**Relay functions:**

`RelayStreamMapleAI(ctx, w http.ResponseWriter, body io.ReadCloser, session *MapleAISession) (*StreamStats, error)`:
1. Set response headers: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`
2. Read SSE lines via `newSSEScanner(body)`
3. For each `data:` line:
   - If value is `[DONE]` → write `data: [DONE]\n\n`, return
   - Base64-decode the value
   - If base64 decode fails → skip (heartbeat/non-data)
   - Decrypt via `session.DecryptResponse(decoded)`
   - Write decrypted JSON as `data: <json>\n\n`
   - Flush
4. Track `StreamStats` (chunk count, timing)
5. On decryption failure → return `ErrDecryptionFailed`

`RelayNonStreamMapleAI(body io.ReadCloser, session *MapleAISession) ([]byte, error)`:
1. Read full response body (bounded read, 10 MiB max — consistent with
   `internal/e2ee/relay.go`'s `io.LimitReader(..., 10<<20)`)
2. Parse as `{"encrypted": "<base64>"}`
3. Base64-decode the `encrypted` field
4. Decrypt via `session.DecryptResponse(decoded)`
5. Return decrypted JSON bytes

**Test plan:**
- Round-trip: generate keypair → encrypt → decrypt → assert plaintext matches
- Wrong session key: encrypt with key A, decrypt with key B → must fail
- Empty plaintext: encrypt empty bytes → decrypt → empty bytes
- Large payload: encrypt 1 MiB JSON → decrypt → verify
- Nonce uniqueness: encrypt same plaintext twice → ciphertexts must differ
- Zero cleanup: all key references nil after `Zero()`
- Interface compliance: `var _ Decryptor = (*MapleAISession)(nil)`
- Relay streaming: mock SSE server with encrypted chunks, verify decrypted output
- Relay `[DONE]`: verify pass-through
- Relay decryption failure: verify `ErrDecryptionFailed` returned
- Relay non-streaming: mock `{"encrypted": "..."}` response, verify decryption
- Pre-header error: verify no partial HTTP response written on early failure

**Reference patterns:**
- `internal/e2ee/chutes.go` for session structure and `Zero()` pattern
- `internal/e2ee/nearcloud.go` for X25519 key exchange pattern
- `internal/e2ee/relay_chutes.go` for custom SSE relay pattern
- `internal/e2ee/relay_test.go` and `relay_chutes_test.go` for test helpers

### Phase 4: MapleAI Provider (`internal/provider/mapleai/`)

**Depends on**: Phases 1, 2, 3

**New files:**
- `internal/provider/mapleai/mapleai.go` — Attester, Preparer, ParseAttestationResponse
- `internal/provider/mapleai/e2ee.go` — RequestEncryptor with key exchange + session cache
- `internal/provider/mapleai/reportdata.go` — Key binding verifier
- `internal/provider/mapleai/policy.go` — Default PCR measurement policy
- `internal/provider/mapleai/mapleai_test.go`
- `internal/provider/mapleai/e2ee_test.go`
- `internal/provider/mapleai/reportdata_test.go`
- `internal/provider/mapleai/policy_test.go`
- `internal/provider/mapleai/export_test.go`
- `internal/provider/mapleai/fuzz_test.go`

**Attester (`mapleai.go`):**

```go
type Attester struct {
    baseURL string
    client  *http.Client
    apiKey  string
}
```

- `NewAttester(baseURL, apiKey string, client *http.Client) *Attester`
- `FetchAttestation(ctx, model string, nonce attestation.Nonce) (*attestation.RawAttestation, error)`:
  1. Preserve the `nonce attestation.Nonce` argument unchanged as teep's canonical
     anti-replay nonce. This remains the value used by the shared attestation
     pipeline for cache keys and report inputs.
  2. Generate a separate UUID v4 `nitroNonce` for MapleAI's Nitro attestation
     endpoint, because MapleAI requires a UUID string rather than teep's 32-byte
     hex nonce format.
  3. `GET {baseURL}/attestation/{nitroNonce}` — do **not** use
     `provider.FetchAttestationJSON` directly, because its error formatting
     includes the full URL path (`"GET host+path: err"`), which would leak the
     UUID nonce into logs/error strings. Instead, perform the GET manually and
     wrap any network error with a fixed path prefix such as
     `"GET .../attestation/<redacted>: %w"` before returning. Alternatively,
     create a thin wrapper around `FetchAttestationJSON` that immediately
     redacts the nonce from the returned error.
  4. Parse JSON response: `{"attestation_document": "<base64>"}`
     (use `internal/jsonstrict` for parsing)
  5. Call `attestation.VerifyNitroDocument(docBase64, nitroNonce)` →
     `NitroVerifyResult`
  6. Populate `RawAttestation`:
     - `BackendFormat`: `attestation.FormatNitro` (new constant)
     - `SigningKey`: hex-encode the X25519 public key from NitroVerifyResult
     - `TEEProvider`: `"nitro"`
     - `Model`: model
     - `Nonce`: store the original `nonce.Hex()` value (unchanged, 64 hex chars)
     - `NitroNonce`: store the UUID v4 string used for the MapleAI challenge
     - Store `NitroVerifyResult` in a dedicated `NitroResult *NitroVerifyResult`
       field on `RawAttestation`. Do NOT overload `RawBody` — it is reserved for
       the unmodified HTTP response body used by `--capture` to write the original
       provider JSON as-is. `RawBody` should still store the raw JSON response
       from `/attestation/{nonce}` for capture purposes.
  7. Return `RawAttestation`

**Required data-model changes for nonce plumbing:**

1. Add `NitroNonce string` field to `RawAttestation` — the provider-specific UUID v4
   sent to `/attestation/{uuid}` and echoed back in the Nitro attestation document.
   Do NOT repurpose `NonceSource`; it has different semantics.
2. Add `NitroNonce string` to `ReportInput` — populated from `RawAttestation.NitroNonce`
   so report generation can include the provider-specific UUID.
3. Extend `evalNonceMatch` with a Nitro path: when `in.Raw.BackendFormat == FormatNitro`,
   compare `in.Raw.NitroNonce` against `in.NitroNonce` (the UUID from `ReportInput`)
   via `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`. The standard `in.Nonce` / `in.Raw.Nonce` check
   remains for all other providers.
4. Keep `Attester.FetchAttestation(ctx, model, nonce attestation.Nonce)` interface
   unchanged — callers continue supplying the standard proxy/client nonce.

**Preparer (`mapleai.go`):**

```go
type Preparer struct {
    apiKey string
}
```

- `NewPreparer(apiKey string) *Preparer`
- `PrepareRequest(req *http.Request, e2eeHeaders http.Header, meta *e2ee.ChutesE2EE, stream bool, path string) error`:
  Matches the `provider.RequestPreparer` interface signature exactly:
  `PrepareRequest(req *http.Request, e2eeHeaders http.Header, meta *e2ee.ChutesE2EE, stream bool, path string) error`
  1. Set `Authorization: Bearer <p.apiKey>` — API key stored on struct, matching
     the venice/neardirect/chutes Preparer pattern
  2. Set `Content-Type: application/json`
  3. Merge any E2EE headers from `e2eeHeaders` (populated by `prepareUpstreamHeaders`)
  4. `meta` (`*e2ee.ChutesE2EE`) is unused for MapleAI — pass nil from caller

**RequestEncryptor (`e2ee.go`):**

```go
type E2EE struct {
    baseURL  string
    client   *http.Client
    mu       sync.RWMutex
    sessions map[string]*sessionEntry // keyed by hex(serverPublicKey)
    sf       singleflight.Group       // coalesces concurrent key exchanges per key
}

type sessionEntry struct {
    session   *e2ee.MapleAISession
    createdAt time.Time
}
```

- `NewE2EE(baseURL string, client *http.Client) *E2EE`
- `EncryptRequest(body []byte, raw *attestation.RawAttestation, endpointPath string) ([]byte, e2ee.Decryptor, *e2ee.ChutesE2EE, error)`:
  1. Extract server public key from `raw.SigningKey` (hex-decode to 32 bytes)
  2. Look up cached session by `hex(serverPublicKey)` under read lock (`mu.RLock`).
     If a valid (non-expired) session exists, use it directly.
  3. If no session or expired: use `singleflight.Group.Do` keyed by
     `hex(serverPublicKey)` to coalesce concurrent key exchanges for the same
     enclave instance. Inside the singleflight callback:
     a. Re-check cache (another goroutine's singleflight may have just populated it)
     b. Create `e2ee.NewMapleAISession()`
     c. Store the 32-byte server public key from step 1 as the session's
        `attestedKey`. This is the key authenticated by COSE_Sign1 verification
        (populated from `NitroVerifyResult.PublicKey` → `RawAttestation.SigningKey`
        during `FetchAttestation`). The session uses this key for ECDH and also
        records the actual ECDH peer key separately so `tee_reportdata_binding`
        can verify the match (see Implementation Implications §1 and §3).
     d. `POST {baseURL}/key_exchange` with `{"client_public_key": "<base64>", "nonce": "<uuid>"}`
     e. Parse response: `{"encrypted_session_key": "<base64>", "session_id": "<uuid>"}`
        (use `internal/jsonstrict` for parsing)
     f. Base64-decode encrypted_session_key
     g. `session.EstablishSession(encSessionKey, sessionID)` — this derives the AEAD
        cipher using the ECDH shared secret and decrypts the session key
     h. Write lock (`mu.Lock`), cache the session, unlock
  4. Create a **per-request copy** of the cached session via `session.Copy()`.
     The copy holds its own references to session_id and session_key (immutable
     values cloned from the cached entry). This is required because the proxy
     calls `Decryptor.Zero()` on the returned session after each request/relay
     attempt — if the cached pointer were returned directly, `Zero()` would wipe
     it for all concurrent and subsequent users. The cached entry retains its
     original key material until explicit invalidation.
  5. Encrypt request body: `copy.EncryptRequest(body)`
  6. Wrap: `{"encrypted": "<base64>"}`
  7. Return `(wrappedBody, copy, nil, nil)` — `copy` is the per-request Decryptor;
     `ChutesE2EE` is nil. `EncryptRequest` does NOT set headers directly.
  8. Update `proxy.prepareUpstreamHeaders` to add a `*e2ee.MapleAISession` case
     in the existing decryptor type switch (alongside `*e2ee.VeniceSession` and
     `*e2ee.NearCloudSession`) that sets `x-session-id: <sessionID>` from the
     session. This must fail closed if the session ID is empty/unavailable.

**Concurrency design**: The mutex protects only the session map reads/writes, not the
HTTP key exchange. `singleflight.Group` keyed by server public key hex ensures that
concurrent requests for the same enclave instance coalesce into a single key exchange,
while requests for different enclave instances (after a restart with a new key) proceed
independently. This matches the `neardirect` attestation fetch pattern and the
`chutes.NoncePool` refresh pattern.

**Session lifecycle**: The session cache stores the canonical `*MapleAISession` with
immutable session material (session_id, session_key). Each `EncryptRequest` call
returns a per-request `Copy()` as the `Decryptor`. The proxy's `Zero()` call after
each request/relay attempt wipes only the copy, leaving the cached original intact for
concurrent and subsequent requests. The `Copy()` method clones the session_id and
session_key byte slices to prevent aliasing. On session invalidation (attestation cache
miss or retry), the cached entry is removed and its `Zero()` is called.

**Key binding verifier (`reportdata.go`):**

For the `tee_reportdata_binding` factor, MapleAI's binding is: the X25519 `public_key`
in the verified attestation document is the same key used in the ECDH key exchange.

Unlike TDX providers where REPORTDATA contains a hash of the signing key (requiring a
runtime comparison between two independent values), the Nitro binding has a structural
component: the `public_key` field is inside the COSE_Sign1-signed payload, so
COSE_Sign1 verification itself proves the key was placed there by the enclave
hardware. However, the factor must also verify that this attested key was actually the
one used for ECDH session establishment — otherwise the factor would be equivalent to
the weaker `signing_key_present` check.

The `MapleAISession` records both the attested key (from `RawAttestation.SigningKey`)
and the actual ECDH peer key used during `EstablishSession`. The session compares
them via `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` before marking the session usable (fail-closed
on mismatch). This comparison is defense-in-depth against code-path bugs that could
cause a different key to be used for ECDH than the one authenticated by attestation.

The `ReportDataVerifier` interface (`VerifyReportData(reportData [64]byte, raw, nonce)`)
doesn't fit Nitro (no TDX REPORTDATA). Options:

- Implement a Nitro-specific verifier that returns Pass with detail "Attested X25519
  public key authenticated by COSE_Sign1 and matched to ECDH peer key" when
  `in.Nitro.PublicKey != nil && len(in.Nitro.PublicKey) == 32 &&
  in.Nitro.SignatureValid && in.Nitro.ECDHPeerKeyMatched`
- Or: the `tee_reportdata_binding` evaluator handles Nitro directly by checking
  these conditions

**Default measurement policy (`policy.go`):**

```go
func DefaultMeasurementPolicy() attestation.MeasurementPolicy {
    return attestation.MeasurementPolicy{
        PCR0Allow: []string{
            // Known-good PCR0 values obtained from live attestation
            // or OpenSecret's published PCR history
        },
    }
}
```

PCR0 values must be obtained from the production endpoint before implementation
(fetch live attestation, extract PCR0, add as hex string). Multiple values may be
needed if the enclave image has been updated. Consult:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSecretCloud/opensecret/master/pcrProdHistory.json`

**Test plan:**
- Attester: mock HTTP server returning canned attestation JSON, verify parsing
- Attester: invalid JSON response → error
- Attester: HTTP error → error
- Preparer: verify headers set correctly
- E2EE: mock key exchange endpoint, verify session establishment
- E2EE: session reuse — second call uses cached session
- E2EE: session invalidation — different server public key → new session
- E2EE: concurrent access — `sync.WaitGroup` + parallel goroutines verify mutex safety
- Key binding: constant-time comparison verified (test with timing-safe assertions)
- Policy: PCR0 match/mismatch
- Fuzz: `ParseAttestationResponse` with random inputs

**Reference patterns:**
- `internal/provider/chutes/chutes.go` for non-pinned Attester pattern
- `internal/provider/chutes/e2ee.go` for RequestEncryptor with E2EE material
- `internal/provider/chutes/reportdata.go` for ReportDataVerifier
- `internal/provider/chutes/policy.go` for measurement policy
- `internal/provider/neardirect/neardirect.go` for Preparer pattern

### Phase 5: Wiring & Configuration

**Depends on**: Phases 1-4

**Modified files:**

`internal/proxy/proxy.go:fromConfig()` — Add `"mapleai"` case:
```
case "mapleai":
    p.ChatPath = "/v1/chat/completions"
    p.EmbeddingsPath = "/v1/embeddings"
    p.E2EE = true  // Always E2EE
    p.Attester = mapleai.NewAttester(cp.BaseURL, cp.APIKey, s.attestClient)
    p.Preparer = mapleai.NewPreparer(cp.APIKey)
    p.Encryptor = mapleai.NewE2EE(cp.BaseURL, s.attestClient)
    p.ReportDataVerifier = nil  // Nitro key binding is verified in the attestation document, not via the TDX REPORTDATA hook
    p.SupplyChainPolicy = nil  // No supply chain attestation
    p.ModelLister = provider.NewModelLister(cp.BaseURL, cp.APIKey, s.upstreamClient)
```

**Proxy relay dispatch**: The proxy's `handleChat` function needs to detect MapleAI
E2EE for both streaming and non-streaming responses. Since `EncryptRequest` returns
`(body, Decryptor, nil, nil)` with `Decryptor` being a `*e2ee.MapleAISession`, the
proxy can use a type assertion:
```
switch dec := decryptor.(type) {
case *e2ee.MapleAISession:
    // Use RelayStreamMapleAI / RelayNonStreamMapleAI
default:
    // Use existing per-field RelayStream / DecryptNonStreamResponse
}
```
This is analogous to the existing `if chutesE2EE != nil` check for Chutes.

`internal/config/config.go:applyEnvOverrides()` — Add:
```
"mapleai" → env: "MAPLEAI_API_KEY", base: "https://enclave.trymaple.ai", e2ee: true
```

`internal/defaults/defaults.go` — Add to registry:
```
"mapleai": { model: mapleai.DefaultMeasurementPolicy() }
```

`internal/verify/factory.go` — Add `"mapleai"` case to all switch functions:
- `newAttester` → `mapleai.NewAttester`
- `newReportDataVerifier` → `mapleai.ReportDataVerifier{}`
- `supplyChainPolicy` → `nil`
- `e2eeEnabledByDefault` → `true`
- `chatPathForProvider` → `"/v1/chat/completions"`

`internal/verify/e2ee.go` — Add `"mapleai"` case to the `testE2EE` switch
(alongside venice/nearcloud/neardirect/chutes). The MapleAI E2EE test path must:
- Perform attestation fetch + Nitro verification (reusing the verify report's attestation)
- Execute the `/key_exchange` endpoint to establish a session
- Send a test chat request with the `x-session-id` header
- Verify whole-body encrypted response can be decrypted
- Verify `session.Zero()` cleans up key material
- Report E2EE test pass/fail in the verification output

`internal/attestation/report.go` — Add `MapleAIDefaultAllowFail` (listed above)

`internal/attestation/attestation.go`:
- Add `FormatNitro BackendFormat = "nitro"`
- Add to `RawAttestation`: `NitroNonce string` (UUID nonce), consider
  `NitroDocument *NitroDocument` or `NitroVerifyResult *NitroVerifyResult`

**Test plan:**
- Config parsing: TOML with `[providers.mapleai]` section parses correctly
- Config env override: `MAPLEAI_API_KEY` env var creates provider
- Unknown provider rejection: verify `fromConfig` still errors on unknown names
- Verify command: `teep verify mapleai` with mock transport

### Phase 6: Integration Tests

**Depends on**: Phase 5

**New files:**
- `internal/integration/mapleai_test.go` — Integration tests

**Mock integration tests** (run without API key):
- Fixture-based replay: capture real attestation from live endpoint, save as testdata
  fixture, replay through full verification pipeline
- `loadFixture(t, "mapleai")` pattern matching existing fixtures
- Assert all Nitro factors evaluate correctly
- Assert report is not blocked with MapleAI allow-fail list
- Assert E2EE session establishment succeeds with mock key exchange

**Live integration tests** (gated behind `TEEP_LIVE_TESTS` + `MAPLEAI_API_KEY`):
- `TestMapleAIModels` — GET /v1/models returns valid model list
- `TestMapleAIAttestation` — Full attestation fetch + verify cycle
- `TestMapleAIChatNonStreaming` — Non-streaming chat completion with E2EE
- `TestMapleAIChatStreaming` — Streaming chat completion with E2EE
- `TestMapleAIEmbeddings` — Embeddings endpoint with E2EE
- `TestMapleAIVerifyReport` — Full verification report (all factors evaluated)
- `TestMapleAIInvalidAPIKey` — Verify rejection with bad API key
- `TestMapleAIConcurrent` — 10 parallel requests verify cache and session safety
  (`sync.WaitGroup` + goroutines, all tests use `-race`)

**Capture tests:**
- Capture mode: record live API interactions for replay
- Self-verify: captured data replays identically

**Reference patterns:**
- `internal/integration/nearcloud_test.go` for fixture-based replay
- `internal/integration/neardirect_test.go` for live test gating
- `internal/integration/helpers_test.go` for shared test helpers

## Verification

1. `make check` passes (fmt, vet, lint, unit tests with `-race`)
2. `make integration` passes with `MAPLEAI_API_KEY` and `TEEP_LIVE_TESTS` set
3. `make reports` generates MapleAI verification report
4. Report shows: all enforced `tee_*` factors Pass; non-applicable factors correctly
   in allow-fail
5. E2EE round-trip succeeds (`e2ee_usable` = Pass)
6. Manual: `teep verify mapleai` produces correct human-readable report
7. Manual: `teep serve` with mapleai provider routes chat requests correctly
8. Manual: concurrent load test — 10+ parallel requests verify no races
9. `gocyclo` — all new functions ≤ complexity 32

## Decisions

- **Non-pinned architecture**: E2EE provides channel security; no TLS pinning needed
  (Nitro attestation doesn't include TLS fingerprints)
- **CBOR library**: `fxamacker/cbor/v2` for COSE_Sign1 parsing
- **Session caching**: Cache session alongside attestation (same 1h TTL), re-establish
  on failure. Session keyed by server public key hex.
- **UUID nonce**: MapleAI uses UUID v4 nonces, not 32-byte hex. Provider generates its
  own nonce format.
- **Factor naming**: Plan uses `tee_*` names. If rename hasn't occurred, implementer
  may use `nitro_*` initially.
- **No supply chain attestation**: MapleAI does not expose compose hashes, Sigstore,
  Rekor, or event logs. These factors are in allow-fail. No sigstore/Rekor
  transparency log entries exist for any OpenSecret or Edgeless component.
- **GPU attestation gap**: MapleAI's Nitro Enclave is a proxy — actual inference
  runs on AMD SEV-SNP backends (Edgeless Privatemode AI, Tinfoil). Sidecar proxies
  inside the enclave DO verify backend attestation (Contrast SDK for Privatemode,
  tinfoil-go for Tinfoil) and re-encrypt/establish attested TLS. However, this
  backend attestation is NOT exposed through the MapleAI Nitro attestation endpoint.
  See "Authentication Chain Analysis §Chain 3" for full source-code-backed gap
  analysis. All backend attestation and GPU-related factors are in allow-fail. The
  report detail strings MUST communicate that backend attestation is enclave-internal
  and not client-verifiable through the Nitro attestation.
- **Source code fully available**: All enclave source code is publicly available and
  auditable: [`OpenSecretCloud/opensecret`](https://github.com/OpenSecretCloud/opensecret)
  (Rust server), [`edgelesssys/privatemode-public`](https://github.com/edgelesssys/privatemode-public)
  (Continuum proxy), and in-tree `tinfoil-proxy/` (Tinfoil proxy). Nix builds are
  reproducible with CI-verified PCR values. However, the sidecar proxy binaries
  are pre-compiled in git — not built from source in the Nix build.
- **Pre-compiled binary provenance gap**: The `continuum-proxy` and `tinfoil-proxy`
  binaries are checked into the opensecret repo as pre-compiled binaries. The Nix
  build copies these into the EIF without building from source. An auditor must
  manually reproduce the binaries from the linked git submodule
  (`edgelesssys/privatemode-public`) or the in-tree Go source (`tinfoil-proxy/`) to
  verify that the checked-in binaries match the source code.
