## Attestation Architecture

Most providers use Intel TDX for CPU attestation and NVIDIA confidential computing for GPU attestation. Tinfoil uses AMD SEV-SNP. Providers differ in how the secure channel between client and TEE is established.

### Venice AI (E2EE)

Venice returns an ECDH public key (`signing_key`) generated inside the TEE. The proxy:

1. Verifies the TDX quote and NVIDIA attestation.
2. Confirms the public key is bound to the TDX REPORTDATA via `keccak256(uncompressed_secp256k1_pubkey)` — the last 20 bytes of the keccak256 hash are placed in REPORTDATA alongside the nonce.
3. Derives a shared secret using ECDH (secp256k1).
4. Encrypts the request body with AES-256-GCM using the shared secret.
5. Decrypts the streaming response using the same shared secret.

The provider's infrastructure never sees plaintext — only the TEE enclave can decrypt.

### NEAR AI Direct (TLS Pinning)

NEAR AI Direct establishes one indexed route per model and binds its TLS certificate to attestation. See the [routing and capture contract](docs/providers/near/near_attestation.md#neardirect-backend-selection) for configured origins, lifetime selection, and fresh attestation connections. The proxy:

1. Resolves the model's subdomain via `completions.near.ai/endpoints`.
2. Connects to the model-specific subdomain.
3. Fetches attestation on the same TLS connection.
4. Extracts `tls_cert_fingerprint` from the attestation response.
5. Verifies the server's TLS certificate SPKI matches the attested fingerprint.
6. Confirms the fingerprint is bound to the TDX REPORTDATA via `sha256(signing_address ‖ tls_cert_fingerprint)` in the first 32 bytes, with the nonce in bytes 32–64.
7. Sends the request through a pool scoped to the provider, authority, and attested SPKI. Every new connection authenticates that SPKI before request bytes are sent.

The report, transport identity, and required authenticated E2EE key form one cached authorization. Evidence expiration alone does not trigger renewal. HTTP/2 streams and reconnects reuse authorization within its attested scope. See the [transport contract](docs/transport/README.md#routes-and-authorizations) for admission checks, key failure classification, and approval withdrawal.

Both NEAR providers require `signing_algo=ed25519` for model REPORTDATA binding.
The signing address must contain the same 32 bytes as the validated Ed25519
public key; it is not a hash of that key. Teep compares the decoded values in
constant time before checking the address, TLS fingerprint, and nonce against
REPORTDATA. A substituted public key fails binding even when repeated response
fields agree. E2EE admission requires successful binding even if `allow_fail`
permits this factor to fail. The gateway's separate signing-address scheme is
unchanged.

NEAR responses use provider-specific typed envelopes with strict nested
decoding. Direct responses must repeat one complete model report consistently;
cloud responses must contain distinct gateway evidence and an unambiguous
model array. See the [NEAR parser contract](docs/providers/near/near_attestation.md) for field
validation, representation comparison, and schema-policy boundaries.

### NEAR AI Cloud (Gateway TLS Pinning)

NEAR AI Cloud routes all traffic through a single TEE-attested API gateway (`cloud-api.near.ai`) that itself runs in an Intel TDX enclave. The proxy:

1. Connects to `cloud-api.near.ai`.
2. Fetches attestation with `provider=near` on the same TLS connection. The response includes model and gateway attestation.
3. Verifies that the gateway TLS peer SPKI matches the reported fingerprint. Attestation authentication also requires successful gateway REPORTDATA binding, which is separately allowed to fail by default.
4. Verifies the gateway's own TDX quote, event log, and compose binding (Tier 4 factors).
5. Sends the request through the gateway SPKI pool with `X-Model-Pub-Key` from its cached authorization. TLS-only requests also require successful model-key binding. E2EE uses the same key for a fresh encryption session. New model backend scopes require full verification.

The gateway hint does not independently prove backend selection. See [NEAR routing and recovery limits](docs/providers/near/near_attestation.md#nearcloud-model-routing).

The gateway adds 13 additional verification factors (Tier 4) covering gateway nonce, TDX quote, cert chain, debug mode, measurement allowlists, REPORTDATA binding, compose binding, CPU registry, and event log integrity.

### NanoGPT (TLS, dStack Format)

NanoGPT runs inference nodes using the dStack TEE framework. The proxy:

1. Fetches attestation in dStack format. NanoGPT uses `signing_public_key` (not `signing_key`) and allows the event log to be either a JSON array or a JSON-encoded string (`eventLogFlexible`).
2. Verifies the TDX quote and event log against the dStack measurement policy.
3. Forwards the request over a standard TLS connection.

There is no E2EE and no explicit REPORTDATA binding for the TLS key — channel security relies on TLS alone.

### Chutes (E2EE, Multi-Instance, ML-KEM-768)

Chutes runs multiple confidential compute instances per model. The proxy uses a two-step protocol:

1. **Discovery**: `GET /e2e/instances/{chute}` returns a list of available instances, each with an ML-KEM-768 public key and a one-time nonce.
2. **Evidence**: `GET /chutes/{chute}/evidence?nonce={hex}` returns the TDX quote and optional GPU evidence for the selected instance.
3. Verifies the TDX quote and REPORTDATA binding: `sha256(nonce_hex + e2e_pubkey_base64)` is placed in REPORTDATA.
4. Performs ML-KEM-768 key encapsulation to derive a shared secret.
5. Encrypts the request body with ChaCha20-Poly1305.
6. Decrypts the streaming response with the same shared secret.

Nonces are managed by a pool per instance to avoid repeated evidence fetches on every request. Failed instances are tracked for failover across the multi-instance deployment.

### Phala Cloud (Format-Agnostic Gateway)

Phala Cloud's RedPill gateway accepts traffic destined for multiple underlying TEE backends and returns attestation in the backend's native format. The proxy:

1. Sends a request to `api.redpill.ai/v1`.
2. Receives an attestation response and inspects the JSON keys to determine the backend format: Chutes (`attestation_type`) or dStack (`intel_quote`).
3. Delegates parsing and verification to the appropriate backend handler.
4. Uses a 120-second timeout to accommodate multi-instance attestation latency.

Channel security depends on the detected backend. Chutes backends use ML-KEM-768 E2EE; dStack backends use TLS only.

### Tinfoil Cloud (EHBP via Router)

Tinfoil Cloud routes traffic through a model router at `inference.tinfoil.sh` that runs in an AMD SEV-SNP enclave. The proxy:

1. Fetches attestation from the router's `/enclave/attestation` endpoint with the model name and a client nonce.
2. Verifies the SEV-SNP attestation report: checks the AMD certificate chain, debug policy, REPORTDATA binding, and TCB version.
3. Extracts the HPKE X25519 public key from the attestation's `report_data.hpke_key`.
4. Optionally verifies Sigstore code measurements: fetches the DSSE bundle from the model's GitHub repo and compares the signed code measurement against the live enclave's SEV-SNP MEASUREMENT register.
5. Creates an EHBP session: generates an ephemeral X25519 keypair, encapsulates against the router's public key.
6. Encrypts the entire request body using AES-256-GCM with the derived shared secret, framed as chunked EHBP frames (`[4-byte length][AEAD ciphertext]`).
7. Sends the request with `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key` header carrying the encapsulated key.
8. Decrypts the response using `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` header for key derivation.

The router decrypts, forwards to the per-model inference enclave internally, and re-encrypts the response. The EHBP key belongs to the router, not the per-model enclave.

### Tinfoil Direct (EHBP to Enclave)

Tinfoil Direct connects to per-model inference enclaves at `{model-slug}.inference.tinfoil.sh`. The proxy:

1. Resolves the model's enclave domain via the `/v1/models` discovery API.
2. Fetches attestation directly from the enclave.
3. Verifies the SEV-SNP report and Sigstore code measurements (same as Cloud).
4. The EHBP key belongs to the inference enclave itself — no router intermediary.
5. Encrypts and decrypts using the same EHBP protocol as Cloud.

This provides true end-to-end encryption: the shared secret is derived between the client and the inference enclave, with no intermediary capable of decryption.

## Verification Factor Reference

Each factor produces PASS, FAIL, or SKIP. Factors marked `[ENFORCED]` cause the proxy to refuse requests when they fail. Run `teep help <factor>` for a detailed explanation of any individual factor.

### Tier 1: Core Attestation

| # | Factor | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `nonce_match` | Attestation response nonce matches submitted nonce. Prevents replay attacks. |
| 2 | `tee_quote_present` | Attestation includes a hardware quote (Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP). |
| 3 | `tee_quote_structure` | Hardware quote parses as valid QuoteV4 or SEV-SNP report. Displays MRTD or MEASUREMENT. |
| 4 | `tee_cert_chain` | Certificate chain verifies against Intel or AMD root CA. Proves genuine hardware. |
| 5 | `tee_quote_signature` | ECDSA signature over the TDX quote body is valid. Proves the quote hasn't been tampered with. |
| 6 | `tee_debug_disabled` | TD_ATTRIBUTES debug bit is 0. A debug enclave lets the host read enclave memory. |
| 7 | `tee_measurement` | MRTD and MRSEAM match configured measurement policy allowlists. Skipped when no allowlist is configured. |
| 8 | `tee_hardware_config` | RTMR[0] matches the hardware config allowlist. Skipped when no allowlist is configured. |
| 9 | `tee_boot_config` | RTMR[1] and RTMR[2] match the boot config allowlists. Skipped when no allowlist is configured. |
| 10 | `signing_key_present` | Enclave ECDH public key present in response. Required for E2EE key exchange. |
| 11 | `response_schema` | Attestation response JSON matches expected schema (no unknown or missing fields). |

### Tier 2: Binding & Crypto

| # | Factor | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 12 | `tee_reportdata_binding` | REPORTDATA cryptographically binds enclave public key to TDX quote. Without this, an attacker can substitute the key while leaving the quote intact, so the client encrypts to the attacker. |
| 13 | `intel_pcs_collateral` | Intel PCS collateral (TCB info, CRLs) fetched for TCB currency check. Skipped in `--offline` mode. |
| 14 | `tee_tcb_current` | TCB SVN meets minimum threshold. Passes for `UpToDate` and `SWHardeningNeeded`. Fails for `OutOfDate` or `Revoked`. Reports Intel Security Advisory IDs when applicable. |
| 15 | `tee_tcb_not_revoked` | TCB SVN is not in the revoked set per Intel PCS. Skipped in `--offline` mode. |
| 16 | `nvidia_payload_present` | NVIDIA GPU attestation payload (EAT or JWT) is present. Proves inference runs on genuine NVIDIA GPU with confidential computing enabled. |
| 17 | `nvidia_signature` | NVIDIA EAT SPDM ECDSA P-384 signatures verified on each GPU cert chain. For JWTs, verifies against NVIDIA JWKS. |
| 18 | `nvidia_claims` | NVIDIA EAT claims valid — architecture, GPU count, driver version, confidential computing mode. |
| 19 | `nvidia_nonce_client_bound` | Nonce in NVIDIA EAT payload matches submitted nonce. Proves GPU attestation is fresh. |
| 20 | `nvidia_nras_verified` | NVIDIA NRAS RIM measurement comparison passed. Complements local SPDM verification by checking firmware hashes against NVIDIA's Reference Integrity Manifest. Skipped in `--offline` mode. |
| 21 | `e2ee_capable` | Enclave public key is a valid secp256k1 uncompressed point suitable for ECDH key exchange. |
| 22 | `e2ee_usable` | E2EE round-trip succeeded with the verified enclave key. Deferred until after the first live request. |
| 23 | `aci_key_custody` | Venice ACI/1 specific: the workload keyset digest recomputes (SHA-256 over the JCS-canonicalized keyset), the signing key is a member of the keyset E2EE keys, and the dstack-KMS custody chain verifies from an accepted KMS root over the app id measured into the quote's RTMR3. Together with `gateway_tee_reportdata_binding`, proves the E2EE key is the gateway's KMS-issued, hardware-bound key. |

### Tier 3: Supply Chain & Channel Integrity

| # | Factor | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 24 | `tls_key_binding` | TLS certificate public key matches attestation document. Without this, a MITM at the provider's load balancer can intercept traffic. |
| 25 | `cpu_gpu_chain` | CPU (TDX) and GPU (NVIDIA) attestations are cryptographically bound. Without this, attestations could come from different machines. |
| 26 | `nvswitch_binding` | NVSwitch fabric evidence hash verified in REPORTDATA. On multi-GPU NVLink nodes, authenticates the inter-GPU communication fabric. Skips when topology does not use NVSwitch. |
| 27 | `measured_model_weights` | Attestation includes hashes of model weight files. Without this, a compromised provider could load a backdoored model. |
| 28 | `build_transparency_log` | Evaluates applicable component provenance and transparency evidence under provider policy. Does not by itself establish a source audit. |
| 29 | `cpu_id_registry` | CPU PPID verified against the Proof of Cloud registry — a vendor-neutral, append-only log of hardware identities verified by alliance members. Uses threshold multisig across Secret Labs, Nillion, and iEx.ec. |
| 30 | `compose_binding` | `sha256(app_compose)` matches TDX MRConfigID (encoded as `0x01 + sha256`). Binds the docker-compose deployment manifest to hardware attestation. |
| 31 | `sigstore_verification` | Checks component digest lookup results under provider policy, including explicit compose-only exceptions. A passing aggregate does not mean every image has a verified signature. |
| 32 | `sigstore_code_verified` | Tinfoil-specific: Sigstore DSSE bundle code measurements match live enclave's SEV-SNP MEASUREMENT or TDX RTMRs. Skipped for non-Tinfoil providers. |
| 33 | `event_log_integrity` | TDX event log replayed: `RTMR_new = SHA384(RTMR_old ‖ digest)` starting from 48 zero bytes. All 4 replayed RTMRs match quote. Proves the log is authentic and complete. |

### Tier 4: Gateway Attestation

Verifies the TEE gateway itself, for providers that route through one:
`nearcloud` (`cloud-api.near.ai`, Intel TDX), `tinfoil_v3_cloud`
(`inference.tinfoil.sh`, AMD SEV-SNP), and Venice ACI/1 models
(`private-ai-gateway`, Intel TDX). For tinfoil_v3_cloud and Venice ACI/1 this
tier carries the only CPU attestation there is — the machine serving inference
exposes none, and the core `tee_*` factors state that.

| # | Factor | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 34 | `gateway_nonce_match` | Gateway nonce matches the client nonce. Prevents replay attacks against the gateway. |
| 35 | `gateway_tee_quote_present` | Gateway quote or report is present in the attestation response. |
| 36 | `gateway_tee_quote_structure` | Gateway quote parses as valid QuoteV4 or SEV-SNP report. |
| 37 | `gateway_tee_cert_chain` | Gateway certificate chain verifies against the Intel or AMD root CA. |
| 38 | `gateway_tee_quote_signature` | Signature over the gateway quote body is valid. |
| 39 | `gateway_tee_debug_disabled` | Gateway debug bit is 0 (production enclave). |
| 40 | `gateway_tee_measurement` | Gateway measurements match the gateway policy allowlists. |
| 41 | `gateway_tee_hardware_config` | Gateway RTMR[0] matches the hardware config allowlist. |
| 42 | `gateway_tee_boot_config` | Gateway RTMR[1] and RTMR[2] match the boot config allowlists. |
| 43 | `gateway_tee_reportdata_binding` | Gateway REPORTDATA binding verified: nearcloud binds `sha256(signing_address ‖ tls_fingerprint)`; Venice ACI/1 binds `keccak256(signing key)` + nonce; Tinfoil binds the HPKE key and endorsed section hashes. |
| 44 | `gateway_compose_binding` | Gateway `sha256(app_compose)` matches TDX MRConfigID. Enforced for Venice ACI/1 — the gateway publishes its manifest with digest-pinned images. |
| 45 | `gateway_cpu_id_registry` | Gateway CPU PPID verified against the Proof of Cloud registry. |
| 46 | `gateway_event_log_integrity` | Gateway event log replayed; all 4 RTMRs match the gateway TDX quote. |
| 47 | `gateway_tee_tcb_current` | Gateway TCB SVN meets minimum threshold (SEV-SNP; TDX defers to Intel PCS collateral). |
| 48 | `gateway_tee_tcb_not_revoked` | Gateway TCB SVN is not revoked (SEV-SNP; TDX defers to Intel PCS collateral). |

## Supply-chain evidence and policy

Supply-chain checks establish different properties. An allowed repository name
identifies a permitted component; it does not authenticate an image. For dstack
compose evidence, [compose binding](internal/attestation/compose.go) compares the
quote's MRCONFIGID prefix with the version byte and SHA-256 of the original
`app_compose` bytes. This binds the manifest to the attested environment. A digest
in that manifest identifies image bytes; a mutable tag alone does not. Neither
form of compose binding establishes a publisher signature or a source audit.

The [component policy and evaluators](internal/attestation/report.go) distinguish:

- `ComposeBindingOnly`: no Sigstore provenance is required for that component.
  Digest-pinned compose evidence supplies the image reference; tag-only manifests
  provide a weaker configuration binding. Do not interpret this policy as image
  signature verification.
- `SigstorePresent`: evaluate transparency evidence, including Rekor signed-entry
  timestamps and inclusion proofs in the provenance path. A configured signing-key
  fingerprint adds an identity constraint; this category does not imply the same
  workflow/source identity checks as `FulcioSigned`.
- `FulcioSigned`: check Fulcio certificate presence, configured OIDC issuer and
  workflow identity, and allowed source repository, together with the applicable
  transparency checks. Some policy entries explicitly set `NoDSSE`, which omits
  the DSSE signature-error check. Such entries must not be described as providing
  that additional signature guarantee.

Repository recognition, signer recognition, transparency, and attested measurement
matching have separate outcomes. Read factor details and effective policy together:
a pass with compose-only exceptions is not a claim that every component is signed,
and an allowed failure remains a failure. Current factor defaults and recognition
rules live in [the attestation implementation](internal/attestation/report.go) and
[provider defaults](internal/defaults/defaults.go); avoid treating a copied list of
factor names as the policy specification.

Provider evidence determines the scope of these checks:

| Provider | Supply-chain scope and implementation |
| --- | --- |
| NearDirect | Model-tier compose and component policy. See [policy](internal/provider/neardirect/policy.go) and [NEAR reference](docs/providers/near/near_attestation.md). |
| NearCloud | Extends the model policy with gateway components. Model and gateway compose bindings remain separate even when digest retrievals are shared. See [policy](internal/provider/nearcloud/policy.go) and [NEAR reference](docs/providers/near/near_attestation.md). |
| Venice | Includes the NEAR model-tier policy for dstack evidence and compose-only gateway components for ACI/1. ACI/1 gateway evidence does not establish model-host software identity. See [policy](internal/provider/venice/policy.go) and [ACI/1 trust boundaries](docs/attestation_gaps/venice_aci_gateway.md). |
| Tinfoil | Signed release evidence and measurement matching use the Tinfoil pathway. Cloud authenticates the router; direct authenticates the selected model enclave. See [policy](internal/provider/tinfoil/policy.go) and [Tinfoil reference](docs/providers/tinfoil/tinfoil_support.md). |
| NanoGPT | Component policy uses `ComposeBindingOnly`; tag-based references do not establish immutable image identity. See [policy](internal/provider/nanogpt/policy.go). |
| Chutes | Uses an explicit no-supply-chain-surface policy; validator-side cosign/IMA is not client-verified image provenance. See [sek8s evidence limitations](docs/attestation_gaps/sek8s_integrity.md). |
| PhalaCloud | Uses an explicit no-supply-chain-surface policy; this is not evidence that upstream software provenance passed. See [provider construction](internal/proxy/proxy.go). |

Provider construction requires a real policy or the explicit
`NoSupplyChainPolicy()` sentinel. A missing policy is not interchangeable with that
sentinel. Measurement allowlists are a separate trust input; see
[measurement policy and provenance](docs/measurement_allowlists.md).

These checks supply admission results. Their reuse follows the
[transport authorization contract](docs/transport/README.md), which separates
HTTP/2 connection reuse from authorization lifetime and publishes authenticated
identity, encryption key, and report together for migrated providers. Other
providers retain their own runtime behavior until migrated. Proposed portable
persistence and operator decisions are specified in the
[cache plan](docs/plans/supply_chain_caching.md), not assumed to be implemented here.

## TOML Configuration

Config file path is set via `TEEP_CONFIG`. File should have `0600` permissions — teep warns on startup if it is group- or world-readable.

```toml
[providers.venice]

  "compose_binding",
  "nvidia_signature",
  "nvidia_nonce_match",
  "event_log_integrity",
]
```

### Measurement Allowlists

Optional allowlists restrict which TDX measurements are accepted. Values are 96 hex characters (SHA-384), no `0x` prefix.

```toml
# VM image measurement — SHA-384 of initial TD image
mrtd_allow = [
  "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
]

# Intel SEAM module measurement
mrseam_allow = [
  "abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789",
]

# Runtime measurement registers (replayed from event log)
rtmr0_allow = [
  "111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
]
rtmr1_allow = []
rtmr2_allow = []
rtmr3_allow = []
```

When configured:
- `mrtd_allow` and `mrseam_allow` are enforced in `tee_quote_structure`.
- `rtmr*_allow` values are enforced in `event_log_integrity` after event-log replay matches quote RTMRs.

Empty allowlists disable policy for that measurement.

Standalone NEAR TLS-only chat probes add an operational `tls_inference` result.
An attempted failure blocks verification and cannot be listed in `allow_fail`.
This result is separate from the provider's E2EE factors and does not claim
E2EE success. See [standalone modes and captures](docs/providers/near/near_attestation.md#standalone-inference-and-captures).
