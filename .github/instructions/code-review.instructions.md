# Teep Code Review Instructions

Teep is a TEE attestation proxy for private LLM inference. It is **critical
infrastructure security software** — protecting confidential traffic is more
important than providing service. Failing closed is a feature, not a bug.

The Teep codebase uses Go 1.25+ and makes use of new Go features. If your
knowledge cutoff does not include Go 1.25 (released on 2025-08-12), assume all
unfamiliar Go code compiles in a plausible way. You will not be asked to
review code that does not compile.

## Data Flow

The Teep proxy receives an OpenAI-compatible chat request → resolves model to provider →
fetches and validates TEE attestation per policy → forwards (or blocks) the request.

The proxy receives concurrent API inference requests to multiple models from multiple client API consumers simultaneously, and should support expansion to handle multiple concurrent providers. All code paths from the HTTP handler inward must be safe for concurrent use. All attestation caches, key pinning, connection pinning, supply chain validation, and supply chain caches must also be safe for concurrent use via multiple clients performing simultaneous access of multiple providers and models.

## Key Code Directories

- `cmd/teep/` — CLI entry point, subcommands (`serve`, `verify`), flag definitions.
- `internal/proxy/` — HTTP handler that accepts OpenAI-compatible requests and routes to providers.
- `internal/provider/` — Per-provider attestation and connection logic (subdirs: `nearcloud/`, `neardirect/`, `chutes/`, `venice/`, `nanogpt/`, `phalacloud/`).
- `internal/attestation/` — TDX, NVIDIA, sigstore, Rekor, and supply-chain verification.
- `internal/e2ee/` — End-to-end encryption sessions and relay logic.
- `internal/config/` — Configuration parsing and strict validation.
- `internal/verify/` — Orchestrates multi-factor verification and report generation.
- `internal/multi/` — Concurrent multi-provider verification.

## Fail-Closed Policy (highest priority)

Every validation check MUST block the request on failure, unless the check has been explicitly whitelisted in an `allow_fail` list, by `--force` (debug builds only: bypasses all enforced factors), or by `--offline` (skips network-dependent checks such as Intel PCS, NRAS, sigstore, and Proof of Cloud).

Flag any code that:

- Returns a nil error, default value, or falls through on a validation failure.
- Catches an error and continues instead of aborting (error fallback).
- Uses a fallback, default, or degraded mode when a security check fails.
- Introduces a "best-effort", "soft-fail", or "skip-on-error" code path.
- Adds backwards-compatible shims that weaken validation.
- Silently drops malformed elements instead of rejecting the whole input.
- Allows an unattested or partially-attested request to be forwarded.
- Serves stale or cached data when re-validation fails, without blocking.
- Accepts unknown, ambiguous, or semantically invalid configuration that should have been rejected at startup.
- Uses special cases to handle the tests or test environment.
- Adds exemptions to teeplint for new code.

If an error path does anything other than return/propagate an error, it is a
defect. There are NO acceptable workarounds, fallbacks, or error recoveries for
security validation.

## Cryptographic Safety

- All comparisons of secrets, keys, fingerprints, nonces, or hashes MUST use
  `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`. Flag any use of `==`, `!=`, `bytes.Equal`,
  or `strings.EqualFold` on security-sensitive values.
- Encryption keys MUST be bound to TEE attestation.
- Encryption MUST be used when requested; plaintext fallback is unacceptable!
- Nonce generation MUST use `crypto/rand`. If randomness fails, the code MUST
  panic or return an error — never use a weak source.
- New tests must ALWAYS use `httptest.NewTLSServer()`

## Sensitive Data Handling

- NEVER log or print API keys, inference request bodies, or response bodies.
- API keys in logs must be redacted (first few characters only).
- Ephemeral key material should be zeroed after use.
- Config files containing secrets should have permission checks.

## Attestation Integrity

- Attestation MUST be verified before any inference request is forwarded.
- The nonce MUST originate from the client, not the server response.
- No provider-asserted "verified" field may be trusted without independent
  cryptographic verification.
- Cache misses MUST trigger full re-attestation, never pass-through.
- Cache eviction under memory pressure MUST NOT allow unattested connections.
- Provider or model routing MUST be unique and deterministic. Flag any selection logic that depends on map iteration order, unspecified ordering, or another non-deterministic mechanism.

## Error Handling Style

- Error returns block the request — no silent swallowing.
- Unknown, misspelled, ambiguous, or semantically invalid config values MUST be rejected at startup.
- Startup validation MUST reject any configuration that cannot produce exactly one deterministic attested route for a request or model, including zero-provider configs and overlapping provider matches.
- JSON unmarshalling MUST use the internal/jsonstrict parser.
- All low-level parsers MUST return unknown field names to callers instead of logging or deduplicating them internally. Callers own the policy decision to fail, warn once per logical operation, or use lower-severity logging in hot paths.
- Malformed attestation data MUST fail the entire response, not skip elements.
- **Do not request nil checks for internal objects and required arguments**.
  In all cases, we prefer panics to fallbacks or workarounds. Never suggest
  fallback-based nil handling.

## Concurrency Safety

Teep serves concurrent inference requests to multiple providers and models
from multiple consumers. Flag any code that:

- Introduces or writes to a **mutable package-level variable**. State that
  varies per-request or per-provider must live on a struct or be passed as a
  parameter. A global written during request handling will race under load.
- Exposes exported package-level `var` state for security policy or runtime behavior when callers can mutate the underlying value, especially maps, slices, or pointers.
- Uses a package-level variable with `save/restore` cleanup (e.g.
  `orig := pkg.Global; defer func() { pkg.Global = orig }()`) in production
  code or in any test that calls `t.Parallel()` — this pattern is inherently
  racy when callers run concurrently.
- Shares mutable state (maps, slices, pointers) between goroutines without
  synchronization (`sync.Mutex`, `sync.Map`, channels, or `sync/atomic`).
- Mutates a struct field that is read by concurrent request handlers without
  holding a lock.

Preferred patterns:
- **Dependency injection** — pass per-call or per-handler dependencies via
  constructor parameters, struct fields, or function arguments. Tests that
  cannot call `t.Parallel()` because they mutate a package-level variable
  are a signal to inject that dependency instead.
- **Channels for coordination** — prefer channels for signaling between
  goroutines; use `sync.Mutex`/`sync.RWMutex` for protecting shared data.
  Use `sync.Once` for safe lazy initialization.
- **Immutable-after-init** — unexported state set once during `New()`/`init()`
  and never written again is safe. Exported `var` declarations are not truly
  immutable — any consumer package can write them; prefer unexported variables
  with accessors or dependency injection.
- Concurrent test coverage (`sync.WaitGroup` + parallel goroutines + `-race`)
  should accompany any new shared state.

## Go Conventions

- Ensure Effective Go idioms and best practices are followed.
- All new code and bug fixes require unit test coverage.
- New providers or major features require integration test coverage.
- Bound all reads from untrusted sources (HTTP bodies, JSON arrays).
- Use `Connection: close` or equivalent to prevent TLS connection reuse
  across attestation boundaries.
- Default test paths should not depend on live external network access. Flag live-network tests unless they are explicitly opt-in via either TEEP_LIVE_TESTS and/or API key environment variable presence.

## Provider Routing Checklist

When reviewing proxy or provider selection logic, verify all of the following:

- Each request or model resolves to exactly one provider.
- Zero-provider and multi-match configurations are rejected at startup, not deferred until request time.
- Selection does not depend on Go map iteration order or any other non-deterministic ordering.
- Security policy, attestation policy, and E2EE policy cannot vary across requests because of ambiguous routing.
- Missing routing prerequisites return a blocking error instead of silently skipping checks or selecting a fallback provider.
- Tests cover both valid single-route cases and invalid zero-route or multi-route configurations.

## Plan Compliance Review

If the requested review contains a removed plan file along with code changes, then the code changes are meant to implement the removed plan.

In addition to ensuring that the code meets the above review requirements, verify:

- All behaviors and features of the plan are implemented, with test coverage.
- All phases of the plan have been executed with clean design.
- Security and reliability of the surrounding code and related components have not been impacted.
- Any problems or requirements that the plan enumerates are addressed and verified with tests.
- Appropriate documentation has been updated.

## Review Style

- Be specific: cite the code location and explain the risk.
- Prioritize fail-open and fallback defects above all other issues.
- Flag any weakening of existing validation, even if "temporary".
- Treat ambiguous routing, parser-owned unknown-field logging state, and exported mutable security policy as recurring review hotspots.
